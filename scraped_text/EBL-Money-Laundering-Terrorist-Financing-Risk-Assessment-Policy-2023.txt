EBL Money Laundering [ML] &
Terrorist Financing [TF] Risk Assessment Policy
1.0 lntroduction
Financial institutions all over the world are facing blazing heat of Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorist
Financing (TF). Perpetrators are adopting modern techniques to use financial institutions as conduit of
money lau ndering a nd terrorist fina ncing. The intention of wrongdoers to conceal the true source of fu nd or
purpose can expose bank to great risk. Failure to safeguard our bank from such perpetrators can result in
violation of Money Laundering Prevention Act (MLPA) 2012 & Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 2009, and BFIU
guidelines which can lead to financial penalties, legal & reputational risk of the bank.
Recent developments shows, robust enforcement actions taken by regulators and the corresponding direct
and indirect costs incurred by banks due to their lack of due diligence in applying appropriate risk
management policies, procedures and controls. These costs and damage could probably have been avoided
had the banks maintained effective risk - based AML/CFT policies and procedures.
First and foremost important step of effective risk management program is to establish comprehensive risk
identification and assessment program. Risk identification and assessment program is reasonably designed
to identify potential risk factors and assess the impact on the bank if the event occurs. This policy will guide
the bank to identify and assess the risk and then bank can then put in place a program that minimizes or
mitigates these risks.
2.0 Obiectives
1. To identify potential Money Laundering and Terrorist Flnancing risks throughout the bank and
regulatory risk.
2. To assess and evaluate the magnitude ofthe risk and possible impact on the bank.
3. To take pro-active measures to address inherent risk associated with customer, product,
geography and delivery channel.
4. To dispose organizational resources on a risk based approach.
3.0 Monev Launderine IMLl
"Money laundering" means -
1. Knowingly moving, converting, or transferring proceeds of crime or property involved in an offence for
the following purposes:-
a. Concealing or disguising the illicit nature, source, location, ownership or control of the proceeds of
crime; or
b. fusisting any person involved in the commission of the predicate offence to evade the legal
consequences of such offence;
2. Smuggling money or property earned through legal or illegal means to a foreign country;
3.. knowingly transferring or remitting the proceeds of crime toa foreign country or remitting or bringing
them into Bangladesh from a foreign country with the intention of hiding or disguising its illegal source;
or
4. Concluding or attempting to conclude financial transactions in such a manner so as to reporting
requirement under this Act may be avoided;

5. Converting or moving or transferring property with the intention to instigate or assist for committing a
predicate offence;
6. Acquiring, possessing or using any property, knowing that such property is the proceeds of a predicate
offence;
7. Performing such activities so as to the illegal source of the proceeds of crime may be concealed or
disguised;
8. Participating in, associating with, conspiring, attempting, abetting, instigate or counsel to commit any
offences mentioned above;
4.0 Terrorist Financing |IFl
(1) lf any person or entity willfully provides, receives, collects or makes arrangements for money, service or
any other property, whether from legitimate or illegitimate source, by any means, directly or indirectly, with
the intention that, in full or in part
(a) lt will be used to carry out terrorist activity;
(b) lt will be used for any purposes by terrorist person or entity or in the knowledge that they are to be
used by terrorist person or entity;
The said person or entity shall commit the offence of terrorist financing.
(2) Conviction for terrorist financing shall not depend on any requirement that the fund, services or any other
property mentioned in subsection (1,) were actually used to carry out or direct or attempt to carry out a
terrorist act or be linked to a specific terrorist act.
5.0 Monev Launderins (ML) or Terrorist Financins (TF) Risk
Risk is the contbination of the probability of an event and its consequences. ln other way; risk can be seen
as a combination of the chance that something may happen and the degree of damage or loss that may
result if it does occur.
Money laundering (ML) or terrorist financing (TF) risk is the risk that an organization, or a product or service
offered by an organization, may be used by perpetrators to facilitate money lau ndering or terrorist fina ncing.
5.1 Maior Risks
Eastern Bank PLC. has identified two specific risks as per the guidelines of Bangladesh Financial
lntelligence Unit (BFIU). Those are Business Risk and Regulatory Risk.

Terrorist Financing [TF] Risk Assessment Policy
5.2 Business Risk
Business risk is the risk that arise from day to day operating activities; bank might have been exposed in
Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing from both external and internal parties. The banks might
assess the following business risks in particular:
Customer Risk: ML/TF customer risk considers the vulnerability that customers may be involved in
money laundering or terrorist financing activities. MLn-F customer risk is significantly influenced bythe
nature and/or attributes of a customer.
Product or Service Risk: ML/TF risk is significantly influenced by the nature and/or attributes of products
and services.
Product / service risk is determined by whether the attributes of a product or service offer features or
characteristics that can be used to facilitate money laundering and/or terrorist financing.
Business/Channel Risk: ML/TF risk is significantly influenced by the nature and/or attiibutes of the
channels used to deliver products and services to customers.
Channel risk is determined by whether the delivery of a product or service involves face to face contact
with the customer, as face to face contact limits the ability for customer anonymity and facilitates
establishing whether the customer is who they are claiming to be.

EBL Money Laundering [ML] &
Terrorist Financing [TF] Risk Assessment Policy
The use of third parties as part of the delivery chain of a product or service also creates a higher ML/TF
channel risk.
Country or Jurisdictional Risk: Cou ntry risk is the assessment of a cou ntry's or ju risdiction's vulnerability
to money laundering, terrorism financing, and targeted financial sanctions. Country risk ratings are
relevant to the location of business operations, customers and third party distributors.
5.3 Resulatorv Risk
Regulatory risk is associated with not meeting all obligations of banks under the Money Laundering
Prevention Acl,2OL2, Anti-Terrorism Act, 2009 (including all amendments), the respective Rules issued
under these two acts and instructions issued by BFIU.
ln addition, the organization's vulnerability to non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations is also
considered, should it not have appropriate controls or adequate responses to those obligations.
Failure to report STR/SAR: Suspicious Transaction/Activity Reporting is one of the core responsibilities
of a bank as per Money Laundering Prevention Acl 2012. Banks shall raise unusual transactions or
activities of customer to the attention of BFIU as due diligence of reporting organizations. Failure to
report suspicious transaction or activity can result in financial penalty as far as license cancellation.

Terrorist Financing [TF] Risk Assessment Policy
lnappropriate Customer verification: Verification of custome/s identity is crucial to confirm true
identity and, subsequently, grasp the nature of expected transactions. Inadequate verification of
customer can expose bank to money laundering and terrorist financing risk. Perpetrators often try to
conceal their true identity and true purpose of transaction to use banks conduit of their illicit activities.
Therefore, regulators have stressed significantly on verification of customers identity through Customer
Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KyC).
lnappropriate Record Keeping: record of customers including Account opening form, Know your
Customer (KYC), Customer Due Diligence (CDD), transaction history etc. shall be maintained as per
regulatory instruction. Regulator may enquire on the information or documents of customer anytime
they feel required. ln that case, if bank fail to provide required documents or information within
stipulated time, regulators may impose fine or penalty.
Lack of AML/CFT Program: During AML & CFT inspection, BFIU often check whether robust AML/CFT
Program in place within the organization. Robust AML/CFT Program includes but not pLC. to risk
identification, assessment, mitigation, reporting, training, independent internal audit, transaction
monitoring, sanction screening etc. Hence absence of vigorous AML/CFT program may create negative
impact on the bank.
5.4 Risk Manasement
Risk management is a systematic process of recognizing risk and developing methods to both minimize
and manage the risk. This requires the development of a method to identify, prioritize, treat (deal with),
control and monitor risk exposures. ln risk management, a process is followed where the risks are
assessed against the likelihood (chance) of those occurring and the severity or amount of loss or damage
(impact) which may result if they do happen.
5.0 Risk Manasement Framework:
The risk management framework has designed to implement AML&CFT programs in compliance with the
existing legal and regulatory requirements and international standards and best practices.
ln assessing and mitigating ML&TF risk, Eastern Bank PLC. considered all its financial products and services,
associated with different ML/TF risks. These include, but are not pLC. to:
' netail & Svt gankine: where Eastern Bank PLC. offers products and services directly to personal
and business customers (including legal arrangements), such as current accounts, loans (including
mortgages), savings products etc. This section includes our priority banking as well.
E  Corporate&lnvestment Banking:Eastern
banking products and investment services
entities,Bank PLC. provides corporate finance and corporate
to corporations, governments and non-government
r Treasury: EBL Treasury has five different desks to prove superior service with respect to pricing
best possible solution for customer requirement and market information. Those are
1. The Money Market Desk
2. Fixed lncome & lnvestment Desk
3. tuset Liability Management (ALM) Desk
4. Foreign Exchange Desk

5. Corporate Sales Desk
. Correspondent Services: banking services are provided by one bank (Eastern Bank PLC. the
"correspondent bank") to another bank (the "respondent bank") and vice versa. Before establishing
correspondent banking relationships, bank must assess the ML & TF risk associated with the parties.
5.1 Risk Based Approach
Governments around the world believe that the risk-based approach is preferable to a more prescriptive
approach in the area of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing because it is more:
Ftexible - as money lauhdering and terrorist financing risks vary across jurisdictioni, customers,
products and delivery channels, and over time.
Effective - as institutions are better equipped than legislators to effectively assess and mitigate the
particular money laundering and terrorist financing risks they face.
Proportionate - because a risk-based approach promotes a common sense and intelligent approach for
fighting money laundering and terrorist financing as opposed to a "check the box" approach. lt also
allows firms to minimize the adverse impact of anti-money laundering procedures on their low-risk
customers.

7.2.2úkelihood scale
Likelihood represents the possibility that a given event will occur. Here Likelihood has be expressed
using qualitative terms (frequent, likely, possible, unlikely, rare), as a percent probability, and as a
frequency.
Here using numerical values, whether a percentage or frequency, the relevant time period is
specified such as annual frequency or the more relative probability over the life of the project or
asset.
7.2.3 lmpact scale
lmpact (or consequence) refers to the extent to which a ML & TF risk event might affect the
enterprise. lmpact assessment criteria may include financial, reputational, regulatory, health, safety,
security, environmental, employee, customer, and operational impacts. Here we have defined
impact using a combination of these types of impact considerations (as illustrated below), given that
certain MF & TF risks may impact the enterprise financially while other risks may have a greater
impact to reputation or health and safety. When assigning an impact rating to a risk, assign the rating
for the highest consequence anticipated.
lmpact of a ML/TF risk could, depending on individualbusiness circumstances, be rated or looked at
from the point of view of the following:
.The risk of actual losses to the business of Eastern Bank PLC.: how it may affect business if a failure
of due diligence caused it to suffer a financial loss from the crime itself orthrough prosecution by
law enforcement or fines from a regulator.
.The risk to reputaiion: how it may affect business if a failure of due diligence allowed it to have
inadvertently aided an illegal act. Such a failure could result in adverse government sanctions and/or
rejection by customers. Here Eastern Bank will also consider how it may affect its wider business
community (market, industry or professional communities). A whole industry may suffer from a bad
reputation as well as Bank's business.
.The risk of furthering a criminal enterprise: a particular transaction may result in a designated
service of our business provides being used to hide the proceeds of crime, orfunds being returned
to a.criminal enterprise to facilitate further crimes. Money laundering has been associated with
crimes such as corruption, bribery, smuggling of goods, people smuggling and slavery, illicit drug
trading, illicit arms-trading, kidnapping, terrorism, theft, embezzlement and fraud.
.The risk of causing harm: that a particular transaction may result in people suffering through the
conduct of crime, or result in the loss of life or property through a terrorist act.

7.2.5 Levels of Risk
Generally, all risk categories can be broken down into the following levels of risk:
Prohibited - Eastern Bank PLC. will not tolerate any dealings of any kind given the risk. Countries
subject to economic sanctions or designated as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Sudan or lran,
are prime candidates for prohibited transactions. Prohibited customers would include shell banks
and people who belong to both lnternational and domestic sanction list.
High-Risk - The risks here are significant, but are not necessarily prohibited. To mitigate the
heightened risk presented, the bank will apply more stringent controls to reduce the risk, such as
conducting enhanced due diligence and more rigorous transaction monitoring.
Examples: Countries that are noted for corruption or drug trafficking are generally deemed high risk.
High risk customers may include PEPs, influential person, head of international organization; high-
risk products and services may include correspondent banking and priority banking.
Medium-Risk - Medium risks are more than a low- or standard-risk of money laundering, and merit
additionalscrutiny, but do not rise to the levelof high-risk.
Low- or Standard-Risk - this represents the baseline risk of money laundering; normal business
rules apply. FATF member countries and domestic retail customers are frequently, but not always,
considered to be standard- or low-risk.
7.2.6 Risk Management and Risk Registrar
After proper risk assessment, Eastern Bank PLC. will focus on the management of the identified risks.
Here we are using examples of customers. We are taking two basic actions against each categorical
risk.

7.3 Stase 3 -Risk Treatment
Risk treatment is to identifying and testing methods to manage the risks as identified and assessed in
the previous process. ln doing this; bank needs to consider putting into place strategies, policies and
procedures to help reduce (or treat) the risk. Risk reduction or treatment steps are:
. Setting transaction limits for higher risk products
. Having a management approval process for higher risk products
. Having a process to place customers in different risk categories and apply different identification
and verification methods
. Not accepting customers who represent unregistered charities and wish to transact with a high-
risk country.

7.3.1 Manage the Business Risks
Bank to have thorough understanding of allthe risks associated with its customers across the group,
either individually or as a category, and to document and update these on a regular basis,
commensurate with the level and nature of risks. ln assessing customer risk, a bank to identify all
relevant riskfactors such as geographical location, patterns of transaction activity (declared or self-
stated) and usage of bank products and services by establishing criteria for identifying higher-risk
customers. These criteria are to be appli'ed across the bank, its branches, and its subsidiaries and
through outsourced activities. Customers those pose a higher risk of ML/FT to the bank to be
identified using these criteria. Customer risk assessments have to be applied on a group-wide basis
or at least be consistent with the group-wide risk assessment. Taking into account differences in risks
associated with customer categories, group policy should recognize that customers in the same
category may pose different risks in different jurisdictions. The information collected in the
assessment process should then be used to determine the level and nature of overall group risk and
support the design of appropriate group controls to mitigate these risks. The mitigating factors can
comprise additional inforfiation from the customer, tighter monitoring, more frequent ui:dating of
personal data and visits by bank staff to the customer location.

Compliance and internal audit team, in particular the chief AML/CFT officer, or external auditors, to
evaluate compliance with all aspects of their group's policies and procedures, including the
effectiveness of centralized CDD policies and the requirements for sharing information with other
banks and responding to queries or regulators. Banks to ensure thaU it has a strong internal audit
and compliance function since these are the primary mechanisms for monitoring the overall
application of the bank's CDD and the effectiveness of its policies and procedures for sharing
information. ihese are to include the responsibility of a chief AML/CFT officer for bank-wide

7.4 Staee 4- Risk Monitorine
. Develop and carry out monitoring process
Monitoring refers the scrutiny of custome/s activity to determine whether those activities are consistent
with the bank's knowledge of the customer. Monitoring transactions is an essential component in
identifying transactions that a re potentia lly suspicious.
Transaction monitoring can done using both manual and automated process. Customers' activity such
as behavior, purpose of the ac€ount, source of fund etc. shall be monitored manually by the
corresponding officers. On the other hand transactions such as fund transfer, deposit, withdrawal etc.
shall be monitored by automated transaction monitoring software. Automated software will assess the
risk of transaction based on the preset rules/scenarios and will generate alerts. Dedicated officers will
assess the merit of alerts and will escalate or release the alerts. Uslng the combination of manual and

automated system for assessing transactional risk and ensuring monitoring. Monitoring shall be carried
out on an ongoing basis.
Banks also ensure monitoring in linewith assessed riskand individualcustome/s risk profiles. Enhanced
monitoring may be applied to higher risk clients; bank shall review high risk customers annually and low
risk customers once in five years. The adequacy of monitoring systems and the factors leading banks to
adjust the level of monitoring should be in line with regulatory instruction for continued relevance to
the bank's AML/CFT risk program.
7.5 Stage 5- Record and Review
. Develop and carry out monitoring process
. Maintain necessary records
. Review risk plan and AML&CFT program
. Perform internal audit or assessment
. Maintain AML&CFT compliance report
Regular evaluation of the AML/CTF program is essential. The AML/CTF program cannot remain static as
risks change overtime - for example, changes to customer base, products and service, business practices
and changes to the law.
All the documents and information of customer obtained during onboarding and continuation of
retationship shall be maintained and preserved. All the KYC/CDD documents including transaction history
of customer shall be preserved till 5 years after closing the relationship. Moreover, documents related
to suspicious transaction or activity shall be preserved until further instruction of BFIU.
8.0 Conclusion
Financial institutions all over the world are facing blazing heat of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.
Perpetrators are adopting modern techniques to use financial institutions as conduit of money laundering
and terrorist financing. Employees of EBL shall follow this policy in combination with other internal policies
to safeguard EBL from money laundering and terrorist financing risk.

Technological, Environmental and Legislative). This list is neither exhaustive nor binding, nor would these
factors apply in every country's ML/TF risk assessment and they should be applied in the context of each
country.
