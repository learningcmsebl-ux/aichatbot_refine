The country had to navigate through an incredibly challenging socio-political landscape in 
July-August 2024. The economy at the same time was facing unprecedented macroeconomic 
challenges due to multiple fault lines created over the years and manifested through dwindling 
FX reserve, slowing economic growth, low tax-to-GDP ratio, persistent high inflation, a 
contractionary monetary policy, and weak governance. Years of unresolved structural issues 
came to the fore, magnifying the impact. Adding to the pressure, Moody’s downgraded 
Bangladesh’s sovereign rating, shifting its outlook from stable to negative.
Defying all odds, EBL’s transformative journey of 32 years has been remarkable throughout 
marked by healthy and sustainable growth—both organic and inorganic. Over the years, 
we have grown from strength to strength, drawing inspiration from our sound governance, 
compliance culture, ethical banking, caring HR policy, prudent risk management and strong 
solvency and liquidity. Our brand personality has been shaped by our passion for performance, 
our drive for innovation, and our proclivity to a strong compliance culture. Amid the challenges, 
something remarkable has unfolded: a shared belief that we can do better, that we must do 
better, for our society and economy.
Our culture of going back to the drawing board, reflecting on our core strengths, and charting 
a clear, navigable trajectory has kept us grounded in reality while giving us confidence to 
spread our wings and fly. 
Bangladesh economy is on a bumpy road amid risks and reforms. But as a nation, we are 
best known for our trademark resilience and indomitable enterprising spirit with which we 
have weathered numerous challenges in the past and are once again poised to overcome the 
headwinds that we are facing now. EBL with its rich legacy of consistency and sustainability 
is ready to self-reflect and navigate through uncharted path ahead.

STEWARDSHIP
Chairman’s Message
Dear Shareholders,
It is a privilege and honor welcoming you to the 33rd Annual General Meeting of Eastern 
Bank PLC.
The year 2024 was unprecedented marked by political changeover through mass uprising 
bringing renewed attention to institutional reforms, restoration of financial discipline and 
macro-economic stability which were long overdue. Against all odds, we delivered the highest 
profit in our history, strengthened our capital base, advanced our digital infrastructure, and 
deepened the customer trust that anchors our relationships.
The current volume of the Annual Report not just records our performance; but also reflects 
the philosophy and culture: how we think, how we lead, and how we prepare for the future.
Economic outlook: navigating complexity
The global economy in 2024 was marked by elevated interest rates, subdued investment, 
and persistent geopolitical tensions. Inflationary pressures, though easing in some regions, 
remained stubborn, particularly in energy and food markets. Central banks across advanced 
economies, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, maintained 
a cautious stance, signaling a “higher-for-longer” interest rate regime. The IMF projected 
global growth at 3.30% for 2025, underscoring a tempered recovery from the policy shocks. 
The August political transition in Bangladesh brought out financial, economic and 
governance fault lines into surface warranting major reforms and corrections. While these 
reforms offer potential long-term gains, the economy encountered several near-term 
pressures. Real GDP of Bangladesh grew by 4.22% in FY 2024, while the World Bank projects 
a further deceleration to 4.10% in FY 2025, followed by a potential recovery to 5.40% in FY 
2026, contingent on political stability, successful financial sector reforms, and improvements 
in the business climate and trade.
Inflation remains a major concern, with point-to-point inflation standing at 10.89% in 
December 2024, driven by factors such as currency depreciation, elevated input costs, and 
structural supply-side bottlenecks, exacerbated in part by energy market volatility and 
periodic power supply disruptions which have impacted industrial productivity. However, 
with ongoing reforms and improved management of external factors, there is a clear 
indication toward stabilizing the economy and laying the groundwork for future growth.
The foreign exchange market has shown significant improvement, with exchange rate 
volatility stabilizing compared to the period before the political transition. The central 
bank’s stabilization measures, including effective management of import pressures and 
strategic interventions, have contributed to this stability. Reserves are being managed more 
prudently, providing a buffer against external shocks, while the balance of payments has 
improved, supported by growth in remittances and export earnings. Moving forward, the 
exchange rate is expected to remain stable, minimizing inflationary risks and supporting 
economic resilience.
On the fiscal front, revenue mobilization continues to face structural challenges. Bangladesh’s 
tax-to-GDP ratio remains below 8% - one of the lowest in South Asia - highlighting the urgent The world is shifting. And we choose 
to shift with it - with care, with clarity, 
and with the quiet conviction that doing 
right today will write a better story for 
tomorrow.

52need for reforms in domestic resource mobilization. While efforts are underway to streamline 
expenditures and enhance efficiency, the fiscal imbalance may still necessitate additional 
government borrowing, posing liquidity pressures and increasing the risk of crowding out 
private sector credit.
The banking sector has not been immune to these macroeconomic headwinds. Liquidity remains 
tight, and the industry as a whole is grappling with elevated credit risks and a lingering trust 
deficit, driven by governance challenges. However, the current administration has prompted 
regulatory recalibration, with heightened focus on prudential standards, supervisory oversight, 
and transparency. These steps, if sustained, can help reset the foundation of the financial sector.
EBL financial performance: solid foundation, sustainable growth
In 2024, EBL demonstrated solid financial performance, showcasing the effectiveness of our 
strategy, prudent risk management, and strong execution across core areas. Amid a complex 
economic environment, our focus on long-term growth, balance sheet management, and 
operational discipline has yielded encouraging results.
Profit after tax (PAT) reached BDT 7,504 million, reflecting a 22.83% increase. Return on Equity 
(ROE) improved to 18.63%, and Return on Assets (ROA) reached 1.34%, highlighting both the 
strength of our earnings and the effective deployment of capital. Earnings per share (EPS) 
rose by 22.89% to BDT 5.53, demonstrating our commitment to consistent value creation for 
shareholders.
Asset quality remained well-managed, with the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio at 3.34% - a 
modest uptick from the previous year but still well below the industry average. This reflects 
our proactive risk governance and credit discipline. Our Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio 
(CRAR) stands at 15.11%, comfortably exceeding the regulatory requirement of 12.50%, serving 
not just as a measure of capital strength but also as a signal of security. 
Apart from maintaining all regulatory ratios (liquidity, solvency), our focus has been on balance 
sheet growth, maintaining asset quality, mobilizing stable deposits, and rationalizing costs 
during the year under review.  
Governance: leading with integrity and excellence
In an industry under heightened scrutiny and evolving expectations, our commitment to 
integrity and institutional discipline remains solid. In 2024, EBL for the sixth time was honored 
with the Gold Award for Corporate Governance Excellence at the 11th ICSB National Award. 
This accolade reaffirms our long-standing emphasis on transparency, accountability, and 
governance.
As regulatory reforms to reshape Bangladesh’s financial sector, we see opportunity for us to 
raise the bar of our governance parameter further.  
Flight to quality: trust as a competitive advantage 
Governance challenges and the lack of trust in the banking industry have long been influencing 
depositor behavior especially in every period of uncertainty. In times like these, customers 
don’t just look for interest rates. They look for safety and reassurance. They move toward an 
institution they can trust, an institution that is compliant.
At EBL, we have witnessed this shift first-hand. The growth in deposits over the year is not 
just a metric, it is a reflection of confidence-confidence in our balance sheet strength, our risk 
discipline, and our long-standing reputation for integrity.
In 2024, we once again retained our AAA credit rating, reaffirming the recognition we earned in 
2023. These ratings are not simply external validations; they symbolize consistency.  
EBL Islamic Banking: let banking be simple with trust
In 2024, EBL launched its Islamic Banking window to meet the growing demand for Shariah-
compliant financial services, serving a community rooted in Islamic values, principles, and 
trust.
At a time when many Shariah-based institutions were facing governance challenges, slowing 
deposit growth, and rising withdrawals, EBL entered the sector with confidence, offering a 
reliable and trusted solution.
As the Islamic banking sector continues to grow, now accounting for 24.75% of total deposits 
and 28.15% of total investments in Bangladesh, EBL’s entry has been met with strong customer ROE

confidence. Within just four months of operation, we attracted 
over BDT 5,000 million in deposits, a meaningful signal that our 
governance, capital strength, and service quality resonate with this 
evolving customer base.
Digital infrastructure: securing the future, 
seamlessly
In 2024, we deepened our commitment to digital transformation that 
enhances trust, resilience, and customer experience by launching 
the latest version of EBL Skybanking mobile app.
Security, of course, is foundational. By maintaining ISO 27001 and 
PCI DSS certifications, we continue to exceed industry benchmarks 
in information protection. Our dual disaster recovery sites and 
strong data governance ensure operational continuity even in times 
of disruption.
Looking ahead, our ICT roadmap focuses on artificial intelligence, 
analytics, and next-generation cybersecurity. With every investment, 
we move closer to a future where digital banking is not just smart, 
but human-centric, secure, and sustainably built for tomorrow.
People: the pulse that moves us forward
We see our people as the capital that truly powers everything we 
do. The real strength of an organization is not measured solely by 
the numbers on its balance sheet, but by the minds and hearts that 
shape its culture, resilience, and ambition.
At the core of our people philosophy lies a commitment to fairness, 
dignity, and opportunity. We maintain a work environment free from 
discrimination - regardless of gender, background, or belief - where 
every individual is evaluated on merit, performance and potential.
In a world where change is constant, our ‘People First’ philosophy 
ensures that every team member is equipped to learn, grow, and 
lead with purpose. When our people evolve, EBL evolves. And when 
they thrive, so does the institution they believe in.
Sustainability: leading with responsibility in a 
world of change
Sustainability is deeply integrated into EBL’s operations. As the 
first bank in Bangladesh to disclose emissions from our financed 
activities, we are committed to factoring climate risk into every 
decision. Beyond compliance, we are undertaking tangible 
initiatives - from solar-powered branches to low-carbon operations 
- that shape a greener future.
Our efforts in green finance, social impact, and ESG stewardship 
have been recognized by the Central Bank. In 2024, EBL was honored in Bangladesh Bank’s Sustainability Rating 2023 as one of 
the country’s top sustainable banks, underscoring our commitment 
to responsible business practices.
In partnership with the Embassy of Denmark and the Embassy of the 
Federal Republic of Germany in Dhaka, we also introduced the ‘EBL 
Climate Change Action Award’. This annual award recognizes local 
businesses, NGOs, and climate activists excelling in climate change 
adaptation and mitigation, fostering innovation and leadership in 
addressing Bangladesh’s climate challenges.
The world is shifting. And we choose to shift with it - with care, with 
clarity, and with the quiet conviction that doing right today will write 
a better story for tomorrow.
Dividend: a reflection of confidence and 
continuity
In keeping with our longstanding commitment to delivering 
sustainable shareholder value, the Board has proposed a 35% 
dividend for the year 2024 comprising 17.50% in cash and 17.50% in 
stock - up from 25% in the previous year. This reflects our confidence 
in the bank’s fundamentals, the resilience of our strategy, and our 
disciplined approach to capital management.
Vote of thanks
As we reflect on our achievements in 2024, I would like to take this 
opportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire EBL team. 
Under the dedicated leadership of Managing Director Ali Reza 
Iftekhar, every member of the team has contributed in our growth 
and building the strong foundation on which we continue to grow.
I also want to express my gratitude to our regulators, especially 
Bangladesh Bank and the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange 
Commission. Their prudent guidance and support have been crucial 
in helping us navigate a dynamic and ever-changing business 
landscape.

54Managing Director’s Review
Dear Shareholders,
It is my privilege to present to you the performance and progress 
of Eastern Bank PLC. (EBL) for the year 2024—an exceptionally 
challenging year for both the economy and the banking sector.
Navigating a challenging macroeconomic 
landscape
Bangladesh’s economy continued to navigate through the 
significant macroeconomic headwinds in 2024. However, issues 
related to governance, low revenue mobilization, persistent 
inflation, and declining investor confidence weighed heavily on 
growth. GDP decelerated to 4.22% in FY 2024, down from 5.78% of 
the previous year (Source: BBS). Political disruptions during mid-
2024 and rising borrowing costs led to stagnation in business 
activity, slower private sector credit growth (7.28% y-o-y), and 
heightened pressure on the financial sector.
Despite these formidable challenges, a stable exchange rate, 
growth in inward remittances, and a gradual export recovery 
offer optimism for the coming year. The banking sector, however, 
remains burdened by a high volume of non-performing loans 
and eroded depositor confidence—necessitating urgent and 
comprehensive reforms.
Strong financial performance amid adversity
Amidst this uncertain environment, EBL has once again 
demonstrated resilience and agility. We achieved robust financial 
results driven by prudent asset-liability management, sound 
governance, strict regulatory compliance, and relentless focus 
on customer experience. Our Profit After Tax (PAT) increased 
by 23% to BDT 7,504 million in 2024, a testament to our strong 
fundamentals and strategic foresight.
Net interest income (NII) rose by 30% to BDT 10,585 million, largely 
supported by repricing of loans at market rates after withdrawal of 
SMART. Investment income increased by 32%, taking advantage 
of higher interest rates of government securities, which further 
propelled a 30% growth in operating income. Through disciplined 
cost management—guided by our Purchase Committee (PC) and 
Cost Olympic Committee (COC)—we were able to limit operating 
expense growth to 18%, improving our cost-to-income ratio to 
40.14% in 2024 from 44.22% in 2023. As a result, operating profit 
surged by 39% to reach BDT 15.94 billion.We also delivered solid balance sheet growth: loans and advances 
grew by 16.23% to BDT 411 billion, and our deposit base expanded 
by 25.02% to BDT 458 billion by the year-end.
Quality portfolio and prudent risk 
management
EBL maintained a strong credit discipline throughout the year. 
Our non-performing loan (NPL) ratio stood at 3.34%, well below 
the industry average of 20.20% as of December 2024. This 
was achieved through rigorous credit assessments, proactive 
monitoring, and effective recovery strategies—demonstrating our 
commitment to maintaining a healthy portfolio and safeguarding 
stakeholders’ interests.
We remained fully compliant with all regulatory requirements. 
Our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) and Capital to Risk-weighted 
Assets Ratio (CRAR) stood at 11.76% and 15.11%, respectively. 
Other key ratios were also in comfort zone i.e. AD ratio (80.19% ≤ 
87%), LCR (190.17% ≥100%), NSFR (119.00%>100%), leverage ratio 
(5.66% ≥ 3%), MCO (13.28% ≤ 16.5%), and capital market exposure 
(20.49% ≤ 25%).We closed the year with EPS of BDT 5.53 and NAV 
(per share) of BDT 31.71.
(For details, please go to the section- stakeholders’ information, 
management discussion and analysis, risk management report 
and notes to the financial statements of this annual report).
Enhancing customer experience through 
innovation
At EBL, we believe customer delight is the cornerstone of 
sustainable growth. In 2024, we deepened our commitment 
to delivering seamless, personalized banking experiences by 
launching a revamped version of our EBL Skybanking mobile app. 
This in-house innovation offers enhanced usability, security, and 
functionality.
Our efforts in digital transformation earned industry recognition: 
EBL Connect received the “Outstanding Digital CX – Cash 
Management Platform 2024” award from The Digital Banker.
Additionally, we expanded our product portfolio by launching 
Islamic Banking operations through 20 dedicated Islamic Banking 
Windows. Our offshore banking platform now offers fully digitized 
onboarding for global clients, supporting foreign currency deposit 
growth and ease of access.We continue to foster a culture of recognition, 
teamwork, innovation, and work-life balance, 
which contributes directly to stronger customer 
relationships and superior service delivery.

56Driving cost efficiency in a high-inflation environment
Cost optimization remained a strategic priority in 2024. We navigated the high-inflation 
environment by leveraging digital platforms, promoting reuse and recycling, and sourcing from 
energy-efficient local vendors. Key initiatives included digitizing product brochures using QR 
codes, revamping our central document archive, and maximizing the use of internal platforms 
for meetings and training.
These efforts enabled us to improve our cost-to-income ratio, ensuring continued profitability 
while maintaining service excellence.
Empowering our people
Our people are our most valuable asset. In 2024, we invested significantly in employee well-
being, development, and engagement. Regular salary increments, enhanced benefits, and the 
introduction of a Critical Illness Fund—from which 8 employees benefited during the year—
underscore our commitment to supporting our team in every dimension.
We continue to foster a culture of recognition, teamwork, innovation, and work-life balance, 
which contributes directly to stronger customer relationships and superior service delivery.
Commitment to sustainability and responsible banking
Sustainability is at the heart of our strategy. In 2024, we reinforced our ESG framework, aligning 
it with global standards. We increased our exposure to green financing and partnered with DFIs 
and multi-lateral institutions for climate risk assessment initiatives. These efforts earned us 
the ‘Best Climate Focus Bank’ award at the 24th National Conference and Green Expo.
We take pride in being a responsible financial partner—supporting businesses large and small, 
enabling job creation, and contributing to inclusive economic growth.
Looking ahead
Despite ongoing challenges, we remain optimistic about the economic outlook for 2025. 
Exchange rate stability, steady remittance inflows, and export recovery are expected to drive 
resilience. With the implementation of structural reforms, we foresee a gradual restoration of 
investor confidence and a more vibrant business environment.
We will continue to prioritize sustainable growth, operational efficiency, and strategic 
investments to create long-term value for all stakeholders. Our aim is to build a future-ready 
EBL—safe, strong, and innovative.
Acknowledgements
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our respected Chairman and the Board of Directors for their 
visionary leadership, to the Governor and officials of Bangladesh Bank and other regulators for 
their continued guidance, and most importantly, to our valued shareholders, customers, and 
partners for their unwavering trust and support.
To the entire EBL team—thank you for your dedication, passion, and perseverance. Your 
collective strength propels us forward, no matter the circumstances.
Together, we will continue to rise, innovate, and lead.

58From the Desk of Chief Financial Officer
Respected Shareholders,
Warm greetings! As we passed an extremely eventful year, let us 
reflect on how we endured as a team and how we will navigate 
through the days to come.
Only the surprises that continue
Business, finance and the economy do not operate in isolation. 
Governance, political culture and the institutions play a crucial role 
in shaping these. Until the one-in-a-century pandemic in 2020, we 
had been enjoying the macroeconomic stability with over 6% GDP 
growth for years. Even before fully recovering from the fallout of 
the pandemic came the Russia-Ukraine war, chocking global supply 
chains and giving inflation a permanent push across the regions. 
These twin blows truly tested our long-held economic stability and 
exposed all the fault lines in our governance, monetary and fiscal 
management, the efficacy of institutions, and the integrity of our 
national statistics. Then came the July (2024) mass uprising to 
unseat the regime, with a heavy price. The interim government 
that took over in early August 2024, under the leadership of a Nobel 
Laureate, was handed the daunting task of rebuilding the nation – 
its economy, businesses, banks, institutions, and so on.
Brief review of the economy, business, and 
banking
The economy had been facing multiple challenges, visibly after 
the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022. Sharp rise in oil and 
commodity prices and systematic money laundering continued to 
put pressure on the FX reserve, pushing inflation into double digits. 
Weak governance and gross mismanagement of some banks led 
to the plundering of depositors’ money. Throughout most of 2024, 
news of large-scale loan scams, money laundering, liquidity crunch, 
and high NPLs were abuzz – heavily denting depositors’ confidence. 
Among those affected, some of the Islamic Banks were hit hardest 
and were placed under reconstituted Board for salvage.
Industry NPLs continued to rise, reaching an alarming 20.20% in 
December 2024 forcing global rating agencies to assign a negative 
outlook for the banking system. Persistently high inflation - the 
slow poison of economy, has been eroding savers’ money, putting 
pressure on business sales and profitability, and leaving little scope 
for the tax authority to increase domestic resource mobilization. 
Private sector credit growth hovered around 8% amid heightened 
chaos in the banking industry in 2024.  Much of the chaos and shocks started to subside as the interim 
government took some bold and pragmatic measures purely in the 
interest of the country. A major success of the new leadership has 
been the arrest of downward movement in FX reserve (USD 21.42 
Billion as per BPM6 as of December 2024), boosted by more-than-
expected inward remittance of over USD 2.5 Billion per month 
and decent growth in export earnings. The efforts to curb money 
laundering, restore discipline in the banking system, and manage 
wastages in public expenditures have been quite visible. Inflation, 
the silent menace, has also shown encouraging signs of subsiding 
and is expected to hover around 8% by June 2025.
Flight to quality
It might seem paradoxical that some banks with proven track record 
of good governance, prudent management, and consistent financial 
performance did remarkably well amid the turbulence in the 
banking sector during 2024. The reason is simple: flight to safety 
and quality. Depositors, shaken by the confidence blow triggered 
by some poorly governed banks, resorted to some well-managed 
banks for the safety of their hard-earned money. Eastern Bank, 
well-known for its compliance and good governance, attracted more 
deposits than expected (25.02% growth), and consequentially, our 
loan portfolio grew by 16.23%  - more than double the rate of private 
sector credit growth in 2024. 
Higher growth of loan yield than that of cost of deposit in the 
post SMART regime helped boost our NII by approximately 30%. 
In addition to core income (NII), 32.40% growth in investment 
income, mainly due to increased volume and higher interest rates 
on government securities and significant growth (over 50%) in FX 
income pushed our operating income growth at 29.71% in 2024. 
However, we managed our costs better and contained operating 
expense growth at 17.74% which helped us maintain cost-to-
income ratio at 40.14% - one of the lowest in the industry. Vibrant 
asset-liability management, lending over 75% of our portfolio to 
large corporates, and the effective centralization of our business 
operations and credit decisions have continued to play a catalyst 
role in containing our Cost-to-income ratio around 40% for 
years, with one of the highest employee productivity levels in the 
industry.

Credit quality, liquidity and solvency
One of our core strengths is our credit quality and provision 
sufficiency. Despite facing a turbulent year, we contained our NPL 
at 3.34% at year-end, while the industry ratio stood above 20%. 
Corporate Banking occupies more than 75% of our loan portfolio, 
while Retail & SME Banking provides more than 68% of deposits. 
Despite having concentration in large corporates – due to deliberate 
and structural reasons, we have been maintaining approximately 3% 
NPLs for decades. We believe large corporate entities have greater 
endurance and agility to withstand uncertainty and turbulence 
compared to SMEs.
We always take our risk appetite and capital status into consideration 
while devising asset growth plan. As directed by the central bank, 
we are gradually converging toward global best practices in loan 
classification and provisioning, including phased implementation 
of ECL based loan classification under IFRS 9. We have been 
proactively working with our borrowers to minimize negative 
surprise in NPL and provisioning despite maintaining a satisfactory 
buffer in provision. Some bold and pragmatic moves taken by the 
central bank including changes to loan classification criteria, 
dividend decisions, and the reconstitution of boards of certain 
ailing banks, have renewed optimism around financial discipline 
in the sector. We have to endure some apparent painful reforms 
for the sake of greater discipline in financial sector in the long run. 
We have a dynamic capital planning tool in place to foresee and 
manage our capital in line with our profitability and asset growth. 
We aspire to maintain a minimum CRAR of 15%, as we have in last 
two years. With 190.17% LCR at year-end, we have maintained all 
the liquidity and other regulatory ratios quite comfortably earning 
us AAA rating for consecutive years.

Outlook
The financial sector of Bangladesh has been undergoing various 
reforms and corrective measures post August 2024. Strengthening 
the capital base of banks and aligning with global standards such 
as IFRS 9 have become key regulatory priorities. In line with 
Bangladesh Bank (BB) instructions, banks have already adopted 
stricter loan classification rules from April 2025 and are now on 
a phased journey to implement ECL-based loan classification and 
provisioning under IFRS 9 by 2027. The recent circular on dividend, 
a pragmatic move by BB, will further help the banking sector to 
strengthen its capital base. We have already completed our internal 
assessments to assess the probable impacts of these significant 
regulatory changes on profitability, liquidity and solvency. Having 
built-up provisioning buffers and plans to raise capital, we are 
getting ourselves ready to embrace these positive changes 
gracefully. 
We understand that we have limited control over the macroeconomic 
and business environment. We may at best forecast their direction 
and intensity. But we know our strengths and aspirations and are 
seasoned to navigate challenges in our own way.

Our economy, business and banking system are grappling with 
numerous odds and are conceding downgraded credit rating with 
negative outlook. Uncertainties and abrupt changes in geopolitics,

60Directors Report 2024
The Board of Directors welcomes you all to the 33rd Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) and is pleased to present before you the Annual 
Report comprising the Audited Financial Statements of the Bank for 
the year 2024. A review of business and financial performance and 
the underlying forces affecting those have been briefly pointed out.
Global economic outlook
The global economy has been grappled with multiple challenges 
since the once-in-a-century pandemic in 2020 spearheaded 
by geopolitical conflicts, weakening of global institutions and 
extreme weather events. These disruptions have strained supply 
chains, triggered energy and food crises, and led governments to 
take unprecedented measures to safeguard lives and livelihoods. 
Economic growth varies in 2024 among nations: China’s growth 
was 4.8% affected by slower consumption despite strong export 
growth. India’s growth slowed more than anticipated due to a drop 
in industrial activity. The euro area, especially Germany, saw weak 
manufacturing and goods exports, though consumption improved. 
In contrast, the U.S. economy grew robustly at 2.8%, driven by 
strong consumer spending. According to IMF, global economy grew 
at 3.2% in 2024.
The global growth is forecasted at 3.3% both in 2025 and 2026. The 
euro area is anticipated to pick up although geopolitical tensions and 
‘reciprocal tariff’ continue to impact sentiment. However, growth in 
the USA is expected to decelerate slightly. Emerging markets and 
developing economies are likely to experience steady growth from 
2025 to 2026, although there may be differences in growth rates 
among regions. IMF projects that global inflation will continue its 
downward trend; expected to decline to 4.2% in 2025 and to 3.5% 
in 2026. Goods prices have stabilized, but services price inflation 
remains high in many regions. However, several downside risks 
persist, including potential escalations in various regional conflicts, 
a resurgence in financial market volatility that could adversely 
affect sovereign debt markets, and an increase in protectionist trade 
measures. Moreover, the impact of ‘reciprocal tariffs’ imposed by 
the U.S. President on global economy is complex and multifaceted. 
It can lead to significant disruptions in global trade, investment, and 
economic stability. An overview of Bangladesh economy
The trademark resilience and macro-economic stability enjoyed 
by Bangladesh for decades had been challenged in recent years 
and multiple fault lines centering around poor governance, 
manipulation of national statistics on purpose, inadequate revenue 
generation, heavy bank borrowing, dented confidence in financial 
system, high commodity prices, low investment, and declining 
foreign reserves—have been exposed. The year 2024 proved to be a 
year of breakthrough due to the change of political regime through 
mass uprising in August 2024 leading to the formation of an 
interim government tasked with addressing Herculean challenges. 
Focusing on both immediate relief and near-term reforms to 
strengthen the economy, the government has implemented several 
key reform measures to stabilize the economy: raising policy rates 
several times to tame inflation, reconstituting the boards of some 
struggling banks, allowing markets to fix lending rates, opening up 
FCY rates to increase inward remittance and improve FX reserve 
etc. These were quite bold moves towards improving economic 
management and governance and addressing long-standing 
structural issues that have held back Bangladesh’s true economic 
potential.
The sudden change in government with an unstable law and 
order situation, disarrayed administration, poor health of financial 
intermediaries and the uncertainty about the future political 
course made private investments stagnant halting job creation and 
slowing industrial growth. Exchange rate adjustments leading to 
depreciation of BDT, lower import demand, a tight monetary policy, 
and struggles to maintain fiscal discipline--all these contributed to 
slowing GDP growth i.e. 4.22% in FY 2024 (Source: BBS), down from 
5.78% in FY 2023.
However, in recent months, Bangladesh’s foreign currency reserves 
and exchange rate have stabilized mainly due to more than expected 
flow of inward remittances, moderate growth of export receipts and 
strict measures to curb trade based money laundering which have 
helped improve the balance of payments (BoP) deficit. Remittances 
surged by 27.6% during July-December of FY 2025, compared to a 
modest 2.9% growth in the same period of FY 2024. Gross foreign 
exchange reserves stood at USD 26.21 billion at the end of December 
2024. According to BPM6, however, this gross foreign exchange 
reserves amounted to USD 21.42 billion.
Inflation remains a key concern; Twelve-month average headline 
inflation rose to 10.34% in December 2024 while point to point 
CPI inflation was 10.89% in December 2024. A surge in inflation 
curtailed consumer purchasing power, contributing to a deceleration 
in estimated private consumption and investment growth. 
Bangladesh Bank (BB) has been continuing with contractionary 
monetary policy to reduce inflation. Despite some progress on the 
inflation front due to the various fiscal and monetary tightening 
measures implemented by the Government and BB, inflation 
still remains high. Delayed and inadequate policy responses in 
earlier periods, contraction of aggregate supply due to agricultural 
production losses and disruptions in supply chains caused by the 
twin floods in August and September 2024 have further worsened GDP growth (year- on- year, in percent)

the inflation situation. However, a decline in global prices, stability 
in the exchange rate, and recent significant increases in policy rates 
should help alleviate domestic inflationary pressures in the coming 
months. BB expects that the current high rate of inflation will come 
down to 7-8 percent range by end-June 2025.
Due to limited revenue generation capacity of the government 
and over reliance on indirect taxes, our fiscal landscape remains 
complex. The tax-GDP ratio is arguably the most disappointing 
indicator in the context of Bangladesh’s development trajectory. Tax-
to-GDP ratio is 7.38% in FY 2024 significantly lower compared to the 
neighboring countries like India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand. 
The implementation of the ADP has been low due to the political 
turmoil during the first two months of FY2025 and reprioritization 
of projects. Private investment remains weak which is reflected 
through declining credit growth, FDI, and SME financing challenges. 
Market and product diversification for exports, FDI promotion, and 
structural reforms are critical for sustainable growth amid global 
uncertainties. 
In H1, FY 2025, country’s exports experienced a year-on-year growth 
of 12.73%, reaching USD 24.53 billion despite the output losses 
due to July uprising and subsequent labor unrests. This surge 
was primarily fueled by the strong performance of both knitwear 
and woven garments accounting for 44.17% and 36.87% of total 
export earnings, respectively. Despite significant exchange rate 
depreciation, tight foreign exchange liquidity conditions, and higher 
borrowing costs due to the strict monetary policy, overall imports 
showed a remarkable turnaround in H1, FY 2025. This acceleration 
in import was mainly driven by strong demand for RMG-related 
inputs, relaxation of import restrictions, stable global commodity 
prices, and increased import demand ahead of Ramadan. Following 
a sharp downturn of 11.11% in FY 2024, imports rebounded strongly, 
an overall 3.5% growth in H1, FY 2025. 
In the first half of FY 2025, Bangladesh’s capital market experienced 
sharp downtrend, primarily fueled by a decline in investor 
confidence. The BSEC is undertaking various reform and corrective 
measures to restore investors’ confidence and stabilize the ailing 
capital market. A Taskforce has been formed to address concerns 
regarding investors’ confidence, liquidity, and transparency in the 
capital market.
In view of addressing financial, fiscal and economic challenges the 
country is tackling with, a coordinated, consultative and pragmatic 
approach is needed to stabilize the economy, protect the vulnerable, 
low- and limited-income households. 
An overview of banking industry
Banking industry in Bangladesh is highly fragmented into two 
broad spectrums (state-owned commercial banks and local and 
foreign private commercial banks), having marked difference 
in mode of operations, service quality, profitability and financial 
soundness indicators (governance, asset quality, capital adequacy 
etc.). Country’s banking sector is currently dealing with rising non-
performing loans (NPLs), tightening liquidity, and slowing deposit 
and credit growth.
After the political shift in August 2024, Bangladesh Bank (BB) has 
prioritized critical financial sector reforms to address longstanding 
structural issues. The key areas of focus include stabilizing 
the macro economy, preventing a potential banking crisis, implementing legal and policy reforms to tackle banking sector 
problems, strengthening BB’s operations, and recovering assets 
stolen from the banking system. To support this initiative, three 
task forces have been formed with the following goals: 
(i) Conducting a comprehensive review of banks’ assets to lay 
the foundation for a wide-ranging banking sector reform 
programs. 
(ii) Enhancing BB’s capacity and efficiency, particularly in 
enforcing regulations and promoting good governance in the 
banking system. 
(iii) Aggressively pursuing the recovery of stolen assets both 
domestically and internationally.
Also, BB has formed a six-member task force to lead these reforms, 
including conducting an Asset Quality Review (AQR) of banks, with 
the support of Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. 
BB has restructured the boards of 11 banks and financial institutions 
to improve governance putting them under close surveillance. To 
address liquidity shortages, BB has provided significant liquidity 
support and guarantees for interbank borrowing, boosting depositor 
confidence and ensuring smooth banking operations. While these 
measures have helped avert an immediate crisis, BB’s focus 
remains on building a resilient banking system through medium-
term reforms based on the taskforce’s recommendations.
Since June 2021, Bangladesh’s banking sector has been struggling 
with a liquidity shortage, which continued into the first half 
of FY 2025. Several factors contribute to this liquidity crunch, 
including Bangladesh Bank’s foreign exchange sales to support 
the Taka’s exchange rate, slow loan recoveries, a high volume 
of non-performing loans (NPLs), and sluggish deposit growth 
despite attractive interest rates. Public mistrust, particularly due 
to irregularities and scams in Shariah-based banks, has led to 
an increase in cash holdings. Additionally, the implementation 
of contractionary monetary policies to curb inflation has further 
intensified the liquidity problem although BB has consistently 
provided various forms of liquidity support to maintain healthy 
liquidity in the struggling banks. These efforts are intended to 
restore public trust by strengthening governance standards and 
developing a resilient banking system.
Deposits of the banking system grew by 7.44% (y-o-y) in December 
2024, which was 11.04% (y-o-y) in December 2023 despite rising 
deposit interest rates. This downturn may be linked to lower 
confidence in the banking sector, stemming from the deteriorating 
condition of few banks, as well as households’ struggle to manage 
increasing living costs due to persistently high inflation. Domestic 
credit growth narrowed to 9.12% (y-o-y) at the end of December 
2024 compared to 11.89% (y-o-y) at the end of December 2023. Of 
the sources of domestic credit, the public sector credit and private 
sector credit grew by 16.32% and 7.28% (y-o-y) respectively at 
the end of December 2024. Due to higher credit demand from the 
government to meet the spending needs as revenue collection fell 
significantly below target, public sector credit growth was higher, 
thereby crowding out the availability of credit for the private 
sector. Rising borrowing cost, stagnant business environment 
resulting from mass uprising and widespread disruptions in 
July and August 2024, along with decreased loan disbursement 
capacity of some banks due to a high amount of defaulted loans 

--- Page 64 ---
62and depositor withdrawal, contributed to slowing credit growth 
in private sector. The overall advance-deposit ratio (ADR) reached 
81.17% at the end of December 2024, compared to 80.38% at the end 
of December 2023. The banking sector has witnessed an alarming 
rise in the non-performing loans (NPLs) ratio. The gross NPL ratio 
reached a significant high of 20.20% in December 2024, up from 
9.00% in December 2023. This deterioration in asset quality may 
even exacerbate by the recent revision of overdue definition by the 
central bank – reducing the threshold for classification of fixed term 
loans from 6 months to 3 months.
The overall capital to Risk weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of the 
banking system fell significantly below the Basel III minimum 
requirement, reaching at 6.48% at the end of September 2024 which 
was 11.64% at the end of December 2023. This decline was mainly 
driven by state-owned commercial banks (SCBs). 
The banking sector as a whole maintained the liquidity ratios i.e. 
Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as 
on 31 December 2024. Maintained LCR of the banking sector reached 
157.50% (provisional) in December 2024, still remaining above the 
minimum requirement of 100% that would cover the banks net cash 
flows for a minimum of 30 days. Minimum regulatory requirement 
of holding Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was maintained at 
105.41% (provisional) in December 2024 compared to 108.45% in 
December 2023. 
Some important initiatives taken by Bangladesh Bank in 2024 are 
as follows:

and Medium sector
• Setting Green Finance and Sustainable Finance target and 
achievement
• Master Circular on Loan Classification & Provisioning

Business, economy and banking system 
outlook 2025
The world economy looks resilient and is projected to grow by 
3.2% both in 2025 and 2026 (IMF: World Economic Outlook Update 
January 2025) despite facing heightened geopolitical tensions, trade 
restrictions, climate risks and policy uncertainty forcing businesses 
and economies to adjust their operations and supply chains.
World Bank projects Bangladesh’s GDP growth rate at 4.1% in FY 
2025 before picking up to 5.4% in FY 2026 assuming broad political 
stability, successful reforms in the financial sector, improved 
business climate, and increased trade (Global Economic Prospects, 
January 2025). However, Bangladesh economy will continue to face 
challenges in the second half of FY 2025 amid not-so-dependable law and order situations, perceived uncertainty around political 
transition, high inflation, rising NPLs in the banking system, 
sluggish economic activity, and slow growth in deposits and credit. 
In response, the government and BB have undertaken several 
reform measures aimed at restoring confidence in banking system, 
and removing man-made road blocks in service delivery by the 
administration. The success will heavily depend on the effective 
implementation of these reforms. 
On the positive note, Bangladesh’s external sector is showing 
resilience with $ 20 Billion plus FX reserve (BPM6) and improved 
BoP position as a result of certain urgent and prudent steps and 
some suitable reform initiatives taken by the interim government 
and BB to improve business environment, attract FDI, and boost 
exports. The stable exchange rate, heartening growth in inward 
remittances and export recovery offer optimism. Securing new 
loans and grants from foreign sources for budgetary support as 
well as institutional reforms is expected to ease foreign exchange 
pressures and support long-term development. Winning confidence 
of the domestic private sector is essential to attract FDI. Easing of 
foreign currency regulations and imports, provision of uninterrupted 
power supply, and tax and trade policy reforms---all these will help 
to improve the investment climate of the country. 
The unusually low tax-to-GDP ratio is a major challenge that 
calls for an urgent tax reform in Bangladesh with an emphasis 
on increased coverage, rationalized exemptions, and enhanced 
compliance. To embrace automation, NBR has moved to simplify 
submission of tax returns and payment procedures through online 
for the tax year 2024-2025. Apart from intensifying the efforts to 
increase revenue mobilization, the government should be mindful 
and prudent enough while prioritizing expenditures given the 
ongoing inflationary pressure.
The banking sector, one of the worst victims of bad governance, 
requires prudent, comprehensive and effective measures to restore 
confidence and stability. The mismanagement of SCBs and several 
PCBs, coupled with widespread malpractices and corruption, has 
significantly contributed to the weakening of the banking sector. 
Political commitment is the prerequisite of undertaking the huge 
task of reforming a sector where stakeholders have become powerful. 
Hence, only through sustained and politically committed efforts the 
banking sector can achieve its full potential and contribute to the 
economic development of Bangladesh. Since August 2024, several 
reform measures have been initiated by the regulators to improve 
the health of the banking sector including formation of various Task 
Forces and Committees by the Bangladesh Bank. Besides, some 
specific measures include the dissolving of the boards of several 
PCBs and replacing with new directors, the implementation of 
the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) methodology-based provisioning 
system for banks, gradual reduction of ‘grace periods’ for unpaid 
instalments on fixed term loans from 6 months to 3 months, and 
updated guidelines on stress testing. 
Bangladesh stands at a crossroad; where the future of business, 
economy and the banking system will depend mostly on how boldly 
and effectively current challenges are met by the policymakers. 
Rather than relying on short-term stop-gap solutions, a 
comprehensive, multi-sectoral approach is essential—one that 
supports reforms, ensures stability, and promotes inclusivity to 
drive sustainable development. Reforms in the economic, political,

Financial performance highlights of EBL
Despite facing challenges, abrupt and complex, EBL managed its 
portfolio efficiently closing the year 2024 with a NPL of 3.34% (3.10% 
in 2023) which is way lower than that of industry average (20.20% 
as of December 2024). 
Our focus in 2024 was to pursue digital transformation initiatives 
to enhance customer experience, intensify collection drive of 
classified and written off loans, mobilize deposits with a focus on 
digital onboarding of NRBs, manage foreign currency liquidity, 
focusing on green projects, and rationalize costs. A brief review of 
financial performances of the Bank (solo) is as follows: 
• Net interest income (NII) which contributed 40% of total 
operating income increased by 30% in 2024 compared to 
previous year driven by 16% loan growth and timely re-pricing 
after introduction of market based lending rate and removal of 
SMART. However, non-interest income which contributed rest 
60% increased by 30% primarily due to 32% growth of investment 
income for upward trend of government securities interest rate 
in 2024 compared to previous year. Higher growth of operating 
income (30%) than that of operating expense (18%) helped contain 
our Cost-to-Income Ratio around 40% leading to 39% growth in 
operating profit which reached to BDT 15.94 billion in 2024.• Total provision charged against loans, investments and other 
assets increased by 78% in 2024 compared to that of 2023 due 
to down gradation of few large contracts, new classification 
and provision for diminution of value of equity securities. As 
per BRPD Circular No. 58 dated December 31, 2024, the Special 
General Provision for COVID-19 has been repelled and EBL has 
reversed the provision (BDT 383 million) as per circular during 
the year. 
In 2024, BDT 891 million (BDT 162 million in 2023) provision was 
charged against quoted securities and BDT 75 million was charged 
for building start-up fund as per central bank’s instruction. As per 
BB SMESPD circular no. 04 dated 29 March 2021 and subsequent 
SMESPD circular letter no. 05 dated 26 April 2021, the Bank has 
been maintaining a provision for startup fund @ 1% of profit after 
tax each year since 2020. All these have resulted in increase of other 
provision by 331% to BDT 916 million compared to 2023. 
• Total tax provision increased by 49% in 2024 compared to 
previous year due to increase in revenue. 
• Finally, Bank’s profit after tax (PAT) increased by BDT 1,395 
million or 23% to BDT 7,504 million in 2024 compared to that 
of 2023.  This is the first time EBL has crossed BDT 7 billion 
landmark of PAT.

Comparative analysis of financial 
performance (2019-2024)
EBL continues to display a balanced performance in 2024 despite 
facing an unprecedented year marked by political change over and 
factors like soaring inflation, liquidity crunch, panic withdrawal, 
exchange rate volatility and NPL build-up. The success can be 
attributed to robust governance model, comprehensive risk 
management approach, efficient & skilled human resources, 
innovation and digitalization in products, services and process 
and most importantly loyal and happy clientele. Leveraging the 
strengths and winning the challenges, EBL positioned itself as a 
Bank of choice and reached to a new height in the financial services 
industry of Bangladesh with an asset size of BDT 616,050 million.
• EBL recorded so far the highest profit after tax (PAT) of BDT 
7,504 million in 2024 (growth: 23% over 2023) which was BDT 
4,008 million in 2019 registering a 15% growth on an average 
in preceding 5 years (including only 2% growth in 2020 during 
Covid-19). Higher growth of loan, investment and deposit along 
with timely re-pricing of loan portfolio after introduction of 
market-based loan rate, efficient asset liability management, 
upward trend of govt. securities interest rate, cautious risk 
management strategy, lower growth of operating expense 
than that of operating income and diversified revenue streams 
enabled EBL to produce exceptional PAT growth in 2024. 
• EBL operating profit reached to BDT 15,939 million in 2024 
(growth: 39% over 2023) from BDT 8,210 million in 2019. Over 
the last 5 years, EBL successfully contained operating expense 
growth at lower level (BDT 4,300 million or 67%) in 2024 
compared to operating income growth (BDT 12,029 million 
or 82%) in 2019, which ultimately helped EBL to post healthy 
operating profit over the years. During the period of 2019 to 
2023, average operating profit growth was 11%, where there 
were de-growth in 2020 (-6%; impact of Covid-19) and 2022 
(-4%; increase in OPEX due to resumption of full operation after 
Covid-19).
• EBL incurred Operating expense of BDT 10,687 million in 
2024 with 18% growth over 2023; mainly driven by salary 
structure revision, routine increment & promotion, increase 
in new headcount, increased investment in technology, 
channel expansion and periodic escalation of rental and other 
agreements followed by rising inflation and depreciation of 
taka. In operating expense growth, domestic inflation played a 
pivotal role in 2024. Inflation (point to point) rate increased to 
10.89% in Dec-24 from 5.75% in Dec-19. On an average EBL’s 
Operating Expense growth was 9% in previous 5 years (2019-
2023) due to low growth in OPEX during Covid-19 period (2020 
& 2021).PARTICULARS BANK

Economic value added* (E = B-D)  1,592,857,937  953,542,254 Economic Value Added (EVA) Statement
This statement measures the financial performance of an entity based on an underlying principle that since management of a company 
deploys shareholder’s equity capital to earn profit; it must pay for the use of it. This measurement tool is useful to shareholders in particular 
and other stakeholders in general to take decision for increasing wealth.  
EVA is equal to Profit after Tax (PAT) plus the provision for loans & other assets less written off interest suspense during the year minus cost of 
equity, the opportunity cost the shareholders forego. This cost of equity is calculated considering the risk free rate based on weighted average 
rate of 10 years Treasury bond issued by Bangladesh Government plus 2% risk premium. EBL management is committed to maximize wealth

Share Price Sensitivity Analysis 
Share price sensitivity analysis using key 
variables with the consequent impact on 
EBL’s earnings.
Share price of EBL in Dhaka Stock Exchange and Chittagong Stock 
Exchange was mostly on a downward trend throughout 2024 
despite positive changes in key variables such as interest rate on 
government bonds, interest rate on loan, foreign exchange rate etc. 
and consequent positive change in EBL’s earnings; the downtrend 
caused primarily by the bearish stock market. 
Average interest rate on loan of EBL increased by 263 basis points 
(2024: 11.85% vs 2023: 9.22%), and therefore, interest income grew 
to BDT 39,270 million in 2024 from BDT 26,541 million in 2023 
(48% increase). Moreover, the 10 year Treasury Bond rate increased 
by 171 basis points (December 2024: 12.53% vs December 2023: 10.82%), and therefore, income from government securities grew to 
BDT 8,237 million in 2024 from BDT 3,909 million in 2023 (111% 
increase). Finally, the BDT/USD exchange rate for EBL was 109.75 as 
at year-end 2023, which increased by 9.34% to 119.99 as at year-end 
2024, and therefore, foreign exchange income grew to BDT 2,145 
million in 2024 from BDT 1,383 million in 2023 (55% increase). 
Partially due to changes in mentioned variables, EBL’s profit after 
tax grew to BDT 7,504 million in 2024 from BDT 6,109 million in 
2023 (23% increase).
However, the change in EBL’s earnings barely had any positive 
impact on its share price, which was mostly impacted by the 1,030 
points or 16.49% fall in the DSEX index; similarly, EBL’s share price 
fell by 16% from BDT 29.4 at the end of 2023 to BDT 24.7 at the end 
of 2024.

80EBL’s Contribution to the Nation: 
Driving Progress
Contribution to the national exchequer
EBL’s contribution towards the country is defined not only by 
financial metrics but by an enduring commitment to the broader 
economic journey. We contribute to national development in many 
interlinked ways - by mobilizing capital, financing transformative 
projects, enabling cross-border trade, creating employment, 
assisting Bangladesh Bank in implementing monetary policy, and 
supporting the government’s fiscal operations through treasury 
investments. These are not isolated actions, but part of a larger 
ecosystem where banking becomes a bridge between policy and 
people, ambition and achievement.
In 2024, EBL contributed BDT 12,672 million to the national 
exchequer - an affirmation that responsible banking doesn’t end 
with profit only. As Bangladesh pursues reforms and resilience in 
an evolving global and domestic landscape, EBL stands aligned - 
with the spirit of service, the strength of trust, and the will to fuel 
sustainable, inclusive progress.
EBL’s total value added in 2024 stood at BDT 273.79 billion, 
representing wages paid to employees (BDT 6.51 billion), taxes 
transferred to the government (BDT 12.67 billion), and net profit 
retained as savings (BDT 7.50 billion). This contribution represents EBL’s direct value addition to the national economy - measured as 
a component of GDP - and reflects its fundamental role in income 
generation and economic development.Strategic contributions

ANNUAL REPORT 202481
INFORMATION FOR STAKEHOLDERS
Indirectly, EBL’s financing activities contributed an additional 
BDT 121.96 billion at the customer level and BDT 125.15 billion 
across customer supply chains, demonstrating its catalytic role in 
economic stimulation and national sustainability.
Financial inclusion and sectoral impact
In 2024, agricultural and rural credit disbursement through MFIs 
reached BDT 6,793.70 million, with an additional BDT 510.55 million 
extended directly through EBL’s network - impacting 143,397 
individuals. These investments fuel rural economies, enhance 
employment, and drive tax contributions, reinforcing national 
development from the grassroots.
Government-backed refinance programs further amplified this 
effort, with EBL borrowing BDT 30,857.42 million under various 
schemes to deliver accessible financial solutions. Our Women 
Banking initiative empowered thousands of female entrepreneurs 
with tailored financial tools, linking gender inclusion with economic 
contribution.
Employment generation and capacity building
At EBL our role in national development goes far beyond financial 
intermediation - we are equally a catalyst for employment, both 
within our institution and across the sectors we support. In 2024, 
EBL expanded its in-house workforce to 4,428, up from 3,857 
the previous year - a 14.8% growth that reflects our enduring 
investment in human capital. With 1,353 new recruits - including 
206 women - EBL continued to strengthen its talent base. Female 
employees comprised 17.19% of the total workforce by the end of 
2024, as the Bank continues to focus on advancing gender diversity 
in the long term.
Through targeted financing across key sectors, EBL contributes 
to job creation across value chains, enabling livelihoods and 
economic resilience at scale. Through strategic financing across 
RMG, agriculture, green energy, MSMEs, and rural enterprises, 
EBL indirectly supported over 600,000 jobs, creating opportunities 
across value chains and underserved regions.
We believe that empowering people begins with equipping them. 
In 2024, EBL conducted 422 structured training programs and two 
phases of e-learning assessments, complemented by extensive participation in certification programs. EBL also arranged targeted 
training for women entrepreneurs under its Women Banking 
platform and led over 100 rural and digital literacy programs to 
promote financial awareness and inclusion at the grassroots level.
Our young future leaders, groomed through the Future Leader 
Program, represent more than potential - they are the promise of 
tomorrow. With a foundation anchored in values, wellness, and 
performance alignment, EBL’s employment strategy goes beyond 
job creation - toward shaping capable people for a resilient, forward-
moving economy.
Socio-economic development and 
sustainability commitment
At EBL social and environmental responsibility is not a separate 
obligation - it is part of how we contribute to sustainable economic 
progress. In 2024, EBL aligned its CSR and sustainability efforts 
with national priorities to build capacity, enhance livelihoods, and 
reduce long-term fiscal pressure on public systems. We view social 
investment as a catalyst for national resilience. In education, our 
efforts spanned scholarships, school-based initiatives, and skills 
training - opening pathways to learning, employability, and broader 
economic participation. In healthcare, we focused where need meets 
impact - supporting pediatric care, mental health, and essential 
services that strengthen communities and sustain productivity.
Our environmental commitments are similarly rooted in long-term 
resilience. In 2024, we supported afforestation, clean water access, 
and medical waste management in climate-vulnerable regions - 
contributing to public health and ecological balance. Internally, we 
advanced sustainable operations through solar-powered branches 
and low-emission logistics, aligning our footprint with our future.
From a financial perspective, EBL surpassed regulatory benchmarks 
by channeling 35.24% of its total term loan disbursements into 
Green Finance (against a 5% requirement) and 89.48% into 
Sustainable Finance (against a 20% requirement) - underscoring 
our alignment with national priorities for inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth.
Together, these initiatives deliver lasting socio-economic value - 
bridging private sector responsibility with national progress.

82DuPont Analysis
DuPont analysis is another extended tool to examine the return on equity (ROE) of a company in details by analysing net profit margin, asset 
turnover, and financial leverage. It gives a broader view to the management in earnings on shareholders’ equity by breaking down the ROE 
to analyze how corporate can increase the return for their shareholders.
Primarily due to lower tax effect and effect of non-operating items, net profit margin was 2.13% lower in 2024 compared to that of 2023. 
However, due to higher financial leverage and 0.07% higher return on assets resulting from higher total asset turnover, return on equity 
increased by 1.79% in 2024 compared to that of 2023.

INFORMATION FOR STAKEHOLDERS
Review of Capital Market Portfolio
The capital market of Bangladesh saw a major slump in the year 
2024, with the DSEX falling by 1,030 points (16.5%). This decrease is 
mostly attributable to the withdrawal of the floor price in early 2024. 
Although there were temporary hikes in the index due to regime 
change in August, it was short-lived, and the index continued 
its downtrend till the end of 2024. However, as the nation is in a 
transition phase and so is the capital market, with major reforms 
taking place, investors may look forward to better days.
In the year 2024, EBL generated 37% increase in total income from 
capital market compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in 
capital gain during the August 2024 upturn.  
Return on investment
EBL managed to make revenue of BDT 287 million from the capital 
market portfolio comprising a net capital gain of BDT 113 million 
and dividend income of BDT 174 million in 2024, where major 
income was generated from the Banking sector.Capital market exposure
EBL kept capital market investment exposure within the regulatory 
limit (i.e. 25% on solo basis and 50% on consolidated basis) and 
complied with relevant regulatory guidelines given by Bangladesh 
Bank. EBL maintained a diversified exposure in different sectors 
within set limit to minimize unsystematic risk with the guidance of 
EBL Investment Committee.

84Statutory and Non-statutory Investments
Statutory investments are made by the Bank to fulfill its regulatory 
requirements and in compliance with Bangladesh Bank ALM 
(Asset Liability Management) Guidelines in order to protect the 
interest of depositors and to maintain adequate liquidity. Pursuant 
to section 33 of the Bank Company Act 1991 (amended up to date) 
and subsequent Bangladesh Bank circulars, the Bank has been 
maintaining Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) of at least 13% of Weekly 
Average Demand and Time Liabilities (ADTL) of two months before 
of reporting month. Besides, for maintaining ALM ratios like LCR, 
MCO, Commitments etc. as per Bangladesh Bank guidelines, the 
Bank has been maintaining high quality liquid assets as statutory 
investments. Therefore, the Bank’s statutory investments are made 
in mostly Govt. Treasury bills (T-bills), Treasury bonds (T-bonds), 
Sukuk bonds and Bangladesh Bank bills.
Statutory investments of the Bank can be categorized as either 
Held for Trading (HFT) or Held to Maturity (HTM). HFT securities are 
purchased to generate capital gain through sale or REPO, and HTM 
securities are purchased for interest income and amortization gain.
As at 31 December 2024, EBL held investment in Treasury bills, 
Treasury bonds and Sukuk bonds of BDT 96,793 million, which 
consists of investment in HFT of BDT 42,611 million and in HTM of BDT 54,183 million, against mandatory requirement for SLR of BDT 
56,689 million. The rate of return of such bills and bonds ranged 
from 8.98%-11.81%. 
While banks are primarily known to use its fund for providing loans 
and advances, a substantial amount of fund is also used in order to 
make investments for below purposes: 
• Mandatory statutory investments for maintaining ratios and 
compliances, and 
• Opportunistic investments for relatively higher return.
Although investments in Treasury bills and bonds and Sukuk bonds 
are considered as mandatory investments, a substantial amount in 
excess of SLR requirement is held for maintaining ALM ratios and 
a better risk free return. On the contrary, opportunistic investments 
(Non-statutory investments) are made into Zero coupon bonds, 
corporate bonds, Preference shares, Capital Market instruments etc. 
for higher return and tax benefit.
Statutory investments are made by ALCO (Asset Liability Committee), 
whereas non-statutory investments are made by the Investment 
Committee as per the Bank’s Investment Policy devised in line with 
Bangladesh Bank guidelines and set limits.

INFORMATION FOR STAKEHOLDERS
Disclosures on Derivative Investments 
(Financial Instruments)
Derivatives are financial instruments whose value fluctuate 
depending on an underlying asset.
The Bank takes position in certain derivatives for trading and 
risk management purposes with the expectation of profiting from 
favorable movements in prices, rates or indices. Derivatives held 
for risk management purposes include hedges that either meet 
the hedge accounting requirement or hedges including economic hedges which do not meet the hedge accounting requirements. The 
Bank has both derivative financial instruments recorded as assets 
or liabilities in notional amounts. The notional amount is recorded 
gross and is the quantity of the derivative contracts’ underlying 
instrument (i.e. equity instrument, foreign currency, reference rate 
or index). The notional amounts indicate the volume of transactions 
outstanding at the year end and are not indicative of either the 
market or credit risk. 
The notional value is the outstanding of the underlying asset which 
is multiplied by using standard midrate.
Derivatives often involve an exchange of cash or other assets in 
the future with little or no initial investment. Common derivatives 
that the Bank deals with are forwards/futures and swaps. These 
instruments frequently involve a high degree of leverage and the 
value of the amounts required to be exchanged can be significantly 
higher than the initial investment. A relatively small movement in 
the value of the underlying asset, rate or index may have a significant 
impact on the profit or loss of the Bank. The Bank’s derivative assets 
and financial liabilities are generally not offset in the statement of 
financial position unless the netting criteria are met as per IFRS. 
Derivatives held for trading
Most of the Bank’s derivative trading activities relate to deals 
with customers that are normally offset by transactions with 
other counterparties. The Bank may also take positions with the 
expectation of profiting from favorable movements in prices, rates 
or indices.
Derivative financial instruments held or 
issued for hedging purposes
As part of its asset and liability management, the Bank uses 
derivatives for economic hedging purposes in order to reduce its 
exposure to market risks. This is achieved by hedging specific financial instruments, portfolios of fixed rate financial instruments 
and forecast transactions, as well as hedging of aggregate financial 
position exposures. Where possible, the Bank applies hedge 
accounting.
Offsetting
The Bank has various netting agreements in place with counterparties 
to manage the associated credit risks. Such arrangements 
primarily include: Repo and Reverse Repo transactions, securities 
borrowing and lending arrangements, and over-the-counter 
and exchange traded derivatives. These netting agreements and 
similar arrangements generally enable the counterparties to set-off 
liabilities against available assets received in the ordinary course 
of business and/or in the event of the counterparty’s default. The 
offsetting right is a legal right to settle, or otherwise eliminate, all or 
a portion of an amount due by applying an amount receivable from 
the same counterparty against it, thus, reducing credit exposure. 
However, the offsetting criteria in IFRS are not met in all cases.
Qualitative disclosures
The Company has a Board approved policy in dealing with derivative 
transactions. The Asset Liability Management Committee monitors 
such transactions and review the risk involved. The Bank’s exposure 
to derivative contracts is monitored on regular basis as part of its 
overall risk management framework.BDT in million

Credit Rating of EBL
EBL has been awarded AAA, the highest credit rating, by Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh (CRAB), reflecting its exceptional financial 
strength, minimal credit risk, and robust liquidity management. This recognition underscores the Bank’s strong fundamentals and 
operational excellence.
Furthermore, EBL was the first Bangladeshi bank to do the credit rating by Moody’s in March 2016, reaffirming its commitment to 
transparency and global benchmarking. Moody’s currently assigns EBL a B2 rating (Bangladesh’s sovereign rating is also B2) mainly driven 
by broader sovereign and macroeconomic factors rather than institution-specific risks. Despite external challenges, EBL remains resilient, 
well-capitalized, and strategically positioned for long-term sustainable growth.

Internal Audit Department 
Internal Audit is an integral part of corporate governance 
framework and plays an important role in enhancing management 
and accountability both in financial and non-financial affairs of 
the Bank. It is the key component in EBL’s assurance structure. 
While all assurance mechanisms are important, coordination of 
various assurance activities provides a holistic environment in 
which internal audit features prominently. Internal audit provides 
key stakeholders with a range of risk-based audit activities to 
assess whether the bank is in line with compliance norms and 
good governance standards. Internal stakeholders include the 
Board of Directors, Audit Committee, Managing Director and senior 
executives while external stakeholders are shareholders, regulators, 
customers and the general public at large.
The department has a diverse range of roles including audit of 
Retail & SME Banking- branches & sub-branches, agent banking, 
Corporate banking, credit risk & administration, trade operations, 
treasury, AML, core risks, information systems, subsidiaries, 
centralized operations and regulatory assignments entrusted by 
regulator on need basis.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024127
GOVERNANCE REPORTS
Additionally, special assignments instructed by the regulator and 
senior management on need basis will be conducted. Internal 
audit submits periodic internal reports and summaries thereof to 
the senior management, MD as well as the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. The head of internal audit provides at least quarterly 
updates to the Audit Committee or more frequently as appropriate. 
Internal audit, monitoring and compliance department coordinate 
its operations with the activities of the external auditor for maximum 
effect.
Internal audit in the era of disruptive technological 
advancements
The digital landscape is evolving at a rapid pace, and disruptive 
innovation is likely to continue to generate profound advancements 
over the next decade. The radical digital transformation will continue 
over the next decade through Edge Computing, Digital-only Banks, 
Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Biometrics, 
Block-chain, Conversational Commerce, Dark Web, Internet of 
Things (IoT), and Robotic Process Automation (among others).
EBL enhances the skillset of the internal audit function by aligning 
with future business and technology strategies. The Information 
System Audit team comprises skilled staff with professional 
certifications, technical expertise, and industry knowledge in 
information and cybersecurity.
Monitoring Department
Monitoring Department contributes to ensure overall efficiency of 
EBL’s internal control mechanism on a perpetual basis through 
monitoring of departments and branches. This department is 
entrusted to protect and enhance EBL's brand value by assuring 
the appropriate practice of internal control system and tools, 
provide advice and comprehensions to the senior management 
and the Board. Control activities are designed and implemented to

2025Monitoring activities
Management reviews: Reports are submitted to Audit Committee 
of the Board and senior management on a regular basis regarding 
operations exceptions and deficiencies of documentations. 
Activity controls: Department or division level management 
receives and reviews standard performance and exception reports 
periodically. Functional reviews occur more frequently than top-
level reviews and usually are more detailed. Departments like 
Business Units (Corporate, Retail & SME), Credit Risk Management, 
Treasury, Operations are the major areas under monitoring 
department’s surveillance. 
Physical controls: Physical controls generally focus on restricting 
access to tangible assets, including cash and securities. Control 
activities include physical limitations, dual control for custodians 
and periodic checking of portfolio. 
Compliance with exposure limits: An important aspect of internal 
controls is a process for reviewing compliance with all limits 
and follow-up on instances of non-compliance. Compliance with 
limits for borrowers and other counterparties reduces the Bank’s 
credit risk and helps to diversify its risk profile. Implementation 
of effective monitoring system helps EBL to maintain low non-
performing asset in its asset portfolio.
Approvals and authorizations: Requiring approval and 
authorization for transactions over certain limits ensures that an 
appropriate level of management is aware of the transaction or 
situation and helps to establish accountability. 
Verifications and reconciliations: Verifications of transaction 
details and activities and the output of risk management models 
used by EBL are important control activities. Periodic reconciliations, 
comparing transactions to account records and statements, help 
identify activities and records that need to rectify. Consequently, the 
results of these verifications are reported to the appropriate levels 
of management whenever any deviation from approved process 
occurs.

Control System)
4.4 Identification of risks
Banks operate in a dynamic and highly regulated environment, 
making them vulnerable to a wide array of risks. These risks can 
arise from both internal operations and external factors. Effective 
risk identification is the cornerstone of a robust risk management 
framework, helping banks to proactively mitigate potential threats 
to their stability, profitability, and reputation.
Identifying both internal and external risks is essential for a 
bank's long-term resilience and compliance. A comprehensive 
risk identification process enables early warning mechanisms, informed decision-making, and the development of effective 
mitigation strategies.
EBL’s organizational structure follows the Three Lines of Defense 
(“3LoD”) model with a clear definition of roles and responsibilities 
for all risk types.Quantitative

Bank and submits reports with observations and recommendations 
to the Audit Committee at regular interval.
Effective anti-money laundering and antiterrorist 
financing program
EBL has established a definitive stance against money laundering 
and terrorist financing, demonstrating a commitment to a Zero 
Tolerance approach. The Board and senior management have 
placed utmost priority to the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and 
Anti-Terrorism Compliance Program. To build a vigorous antimony 
laundering and anti-terrorism program, EBL has deployed necessary 
resource and manpower. Central Compliance Committee (CCC) has 
been reconstructed with 14 crucial department/division heads so 
that they can actively contribute to AML/CFT compliance program. 
Triple C is chaired by CAMLCO who is responsible for overall AML & 
CFT Compliance of the bank. A dedicated department “Anti Money 
Laundering Department (AMLD)”, headed by Deputy CAMLCO, acts

5.5 Directors’ interest in significant contracts and 
arrangements 
Related party transactions
The Bank in its ordinary course of business undertook financial 
transactions with some entities or persons that fall within the 
definition of ‘Related Party’ as contained in IAS 24 (Related Party 
Disclosures) and relevant provisions of Bank Company Act 1991 and 
Bangladesh Bank BRPD Circular No. 12 dated 15 June 2022.  
Following Bangladesh Bank BRPD circular -12 dated 15 June 2022 
(restricting banks from procuring goods or services from “related 
parties”), EBL discontinued procuring goods and services (i.e. 
courier, internet, refreshment items etc.) from respective related 
party entities except Unique Hotel & Resorts PLC and replaced all 
those by suitable alternatives. However, EBL Skylounge situated 
at HSIA, Dhaka for which service is taken from Unique Hotel & 
Resorts PLC (UHRL) is yet to be replaced due to its unique nature of 
propositions and absence of ready and suitable alternatives.
Considering the business sensitivity (especially cards business) 
and unavailability of suitable alternative for replacing UHRL, EBL 
applied and got permission from Bangladesh Bank to continue with 
the UHRL till 30th June 2025. 
5.6 Related Parties 
The Bank in its ordinary course of business undertook financial 
transactions with some entities or persons that fall within the 
definition of ‘Related Party’ as contained in IAS 24 (Related Party 
Disclosures) and relevant provisions of Bank Company Act 1991 and 
Bangladesh Bank BRPD Circular No. 12 dated 15 June 2022.  
Please refer to Annexure C1 of financial statements for details of 
related party transactions. (Page 432)
5.7 Business continuity plan or disaster recovery 
Ensuring operational resilience is a top priority for EBL, enabling 
uninterrupted services even during unforeseen events. These 
events may include natural disasters such as fires, floods, and 
earthquakes, as well as man-made disruptions like power outages, 
connectivity failures, and explosions. EBL's approved Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) provides a comprehensive framework of 
actions to be executed before, during, and after crises, ensuring 
swift and effective responses.
EBL's disaster recovery capabilities are supported by two 
geographically dispersed Disaster Recovery Sites (DRS): Dilkusha 
serves as the near DRS for immediate restoration, while Jashore 
functions as the far DRS for long-term continuity. Tailored 
data backup and retention strategies have been implemented, 
minimizing the risk of information loss and aligning with the 
criticality of each system.
Annual disaster recovery (DR) drills are conducted by EBL to simulate 
real-world disruptions. In the latest exercise, EBL successfully tested 
its ability to resume critical operations—including core banking 
systems, card management systems, BACH2, BEFTN, Skybanking, 
and OBDX—during a complete data center failure. These simulations 
provide valuable insights for continuous enhancement of the DRP , 
reinforcing EBL’s robust and adaptive approach to navigating 
challenges and maintaining seamless service continuity.
5.8 Board’s policy on IT governance
The BoD has established a comprehensive framework for IT 
governance to ensure the effective management of Information 
Technology as a cornerstone of innovation, operational efficiency,

Going Concern and Viability
The going concern concept, a fundamental assumption used to 
prepare financial statements, is an accounting principle that 
assumes an entity is financially stable enough to meet its obligations 
and continue its business for the foreseeable future. Based on our assessment of financial performance, payment of obligations, 
business expansion, dividend consistency, capital adequacy, risk 
management practices and other relevant factors, we are confident 
about EBL’s operation as going concern.
Good governance for sustainability
Board of Directors of EBL plays a pivotal role in shaping the 
governance structure and practices through their choice of 
strategy and leadership to drive the Bank to growth path. The 
management of EBL executes policies and procedures set by the 
Board. Our well-functioning Board provides judicious guidance 
and support to MD and his team to carry out business. We uphold 
strong and effective corporate governance practices to cultivate a 
culture of accountability, integrity, transparency, sound financial 
management, which ultimately leads to sustainable business and 
financial performance. The Bank management proactively supports 
establishing simple and efficient processes focusing on compliance 
and relevant regulations in order for sustainable value creation. 
These efforts have well been recognized by the ICSB National Award 
for Corporate Governance Excellence who conferred us Gold Awards 
for a number of times.Credit rating

term rating “ST-1” to EBL on 28 May 2024. This rating indicates

The Bank has been maintaining adequate capital consistently above 
its regulatory requirement. Minimum capital requirement of the 
Bank as of 31 December 2024 was BDT 34,311 million whereas EBL maintained BDT 51,846 million that led to CRAR 15.11% of which 
core capital to RWA was 11.76% that indicates how efficiently and 
optimally EBL manages its capital and maintains a strong capital 
base to meet up regulatory requirements and cushion business 
growth.
Risk management

operations, forming the foundation for all strategic decisions.

sustained growth and create lasting value.
Service excellence
We are dedicated to delivering consistent, convenient, and 
standardized customer service. To achieve this, we continuously 
enhance our service excellence by leveraging technology and process 
re-engineering. Acknowledging the ongoing digital transformation 
in the banking sector, we have positioned ourselves as a leading 
force in digital banking. This strategic shift has significantly 
improved the customer experience by fostering better connectivity 
through a comprehensive approach. We value customer feedback, 
as it helps us understand evolving needs and expectations, enabling 
us to build and maintain strong relationships with our customers.
Data security and privacy
Foundation of banking lies in nurturing trust and credibility. 
Cyber security is key for Banks to keep customers’ money safe 
and secure. As the banking transaction moves towards cashless, 
now it is very crucial for us to ensure that managing cybersecurity 
issues is in right place to protect data and confidentiality. We have 
taken several preventive controls to safeguard the Bank from data 
breach. To provide customers with the comfort and reliability to 
use digital channels for transactions, our all-out efforts to maintain 
transactional security is undefeated. Our PCI-DSS certification for 
consecutive eight years recognizes our constant effort to minimize 
vulnerabilities in cardholder data domain for providing reliability to

IEC. With the rise of digitization, cyber resilience is an important feature for the banks. Winning Financial Institution Cyber Drill

cyber security related incident handling.  
Strong brand image

2018-2020 by the Superbrands Bangladesh etc. Also, EBL is also

and discrimination-free work environment that promotes equal 
opportunities, ensures work-life balance, encourages employee 
engagement, supports personal development, and prioritizes health

the Bank along with retention of talents. We believe in connecting 
with our people to win loyalty, promoting employee engagement 
and motivating them to excel in our journey to build a strong and 
vibrant brand. As a part of recognition, EBL has received Bangladesh

unchallenged

a going concern. EBL has neither intention nor the need to liquidate 
or curtail materially the scale of its operations and the Bank will 
continue to operate for the foreseeable future. Hence, the financial

RISK MANAGEMENT
MANAGEMENT

172From The Desk of Chief Risk Officer
Dear Stakeholders,
As we reflect on the challenges and opportunities of the past year and 
navigate the evolving financial landscape, EBL remains persistent 
in its commitment to robust risk management. The theme of this 
year’s annual report, “Reflect. Navigate,” perfectly captures our 
approach to risk; learning from the past while proactively preparing 
for the future.
Risk management at EBL is deeply embedded in our corporate 
culture, ensuring resilience and stability amid an increasingly 
complex environment. Our unwavering focus on strong governance, 
comprehensive risk assessment, and proactive mitigation strategies 
has enabled us to not only safeguard our stakeholders’ interests but 
also foster sustainable growth and value creation.
The banking industry is continuously getting reshaped by economic 
fluctuations, regulatory changes, technological advancements and 
geopolitical uncertainties. EBL has effectively steered through these 
challenges by maintaining a disciplined risk culture, leveraging 
cutting-edge analytical tools and implementing robust internal 
controls. In 2024, regulatory shifts including tightened monetary 
policies and evolving loan classification standards demanded a 
recalibration of risk strategies. In response, EBL has strengthened 
its credit risk management framework, enhanced asset quality 
monitoring, and reinforced our provisioning mechanisms to 
ensure long-term financial health. Our early warning systems 
have significantly reduced default rates and enhanced the overall 
resilience of our loan portfolio.
Interest rate volatility had been a key challenge, particularly with 
the transition from fixed cap rates to a market-driven SMART 
rate regime. We have remained vigilant in managing interest rate 
risks, employing advanced scenario analysis and stress testing to 
protect our earnings and maintain capital adequacy. Additionally, 
the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework introduced by the 
Central Bank further underscores the need for prudential risk 
management and operational efficiency. EBL continues to optimize 
capital deployment while ensuring strict regulatory compliance.
Our risk management framework has played a critical role in EBL’s 
continued success. Some key achievements in 2024 include:
• Managing NPL: Through enhanced risk monitoring and 
recovery strategies, we have successfully contained our non-
performing loan (NPL) ratio way below the industry average. 
• Robust Capital Position: We maintained a Capital to 
Risk weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) well above regulatory 
requirements, ensuring financial stability and investor 
confidence.
• Operational Risk Strengthening: Through process automation 
and robust internal control mechanisms, we have minimized 
operational disruptions and enhanced efficiency.
• Improved Liquidity Management: Our prudent approach to 
liquidity risk has ensured a stable funding base and enhanced 
our ability to support economic growth.EBL’s risk management philosophy is built on three core pillars: 
robust governance, proactive risk assessment, and strategic 
adaptability. Our Board of Directors and Risk Management 
Committee of the Board oversee a comprehensive Risk Management 
framework ensuring an integrated approach to managing credit, 
market, liquidity, operational and compliance risks. We employ 
advanced risk modeling techniques, scenario analysis, and stress 
testing to anticipate potential threats and formulate proactive 
mitigation strategies. Our strong risk culture ensures that risk 
awareness is ingrained at every level of the organization from 
frontline staff to senior leadership.
EBL recognizes the growing importance of Environmental and 
Social Risk Management (ESRM) in ensuring long-term financial 
and societal well-being. As a responsible financial institution, we 
have integrated ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) 
considerations into our risk assessment framework reinforcing 
our commitment to sustainable banking practices. In 2024, we 
made significant progress in ESRM by implementing enhanced 
due diligence measures for projects with potential environmental 
and social impacts. We have increased our financing in green and 
sustainable projects, including renewable energy, energy-efficient 
infrastructure and climate-resilient industries. Furthermore, 
EBL continues to engage with clients and businesses to promote 
sustainability-linked lending, ensuring that enterprises adhere to 
ethical and environmentally responsible business practices. We 
also enhanced our social risk screening mechanisms, prioritizing 
financial inclusion, gender equality, and fair labor practices in our 
lending portfolio.
In cybersecurity and technology risk management, we have 
implemented next-generation security frameworks, ensuring data 
integrity and customer protection against evolving cyber threats. 
Our commitment to digital transformation has further enhanced 
our ability to detect, assess, and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in 
real time. Our commitment to sound risk management ensures that 
we not only withstand uncertainties but also seize opportunities for 
growth. We will continue to strengthen our governance frameworks, 
leverage digital advancements and adapt to emerging regulatory 
requirements while upholding integrity, transparency, and service 
excellence.
I extend my sincere gratitude to our stakeholders—customers, 
regulators, employees, and shareholders for their unwavering 
trust and support. With a strong risk management foundation 
and a forward-looking approach, EBL is well positioned to drive 
sustainable success and create lasting value for all.
Sincerely,
          Sd/-

to maintain a prudent equilibrium between risk exposure and 
potential rewards. EBL’s Enterprise-Wide Risk Management 
Framework serves as the guiding framework to fulfill these 
objectives effectively.

documentation deferral are some  initiatives among 
others. All these steps were taken for the survival of the 
clients’ business and hence it has reduced credit risk.
Initiating clearer segmentation to identify potential 
vulnerable industries/customer clusters and accordingly 
modifying risk mitigation processes. Also, initiating 
impact estimation under various scenarios to determine 
potential provision needs.
Digitalizing documentation process to reduce lead time 
of credit appraisal and disbursement.
EBL has been measuring Scope 3 emissions from the 
portfolio it finances through the Joint Impact Model 
(JIM) in partnership with DEG.EBL’s collaboration with DHL under the Go-Green Plus 
initiative is projected to achieve a 30% reduction in 
emissions from the transportation of trade-related 
documents.
Adopted IFRS S1 sustainability-related and S2 climate-
related financial disclosure standards.
Collaborating with DEG and Adelphi, EBL developed 
a streamlined process for assessing loans for green 
projects. This has simplified green financing and 
encouraged investments in eco-friendly ventures.
All four risk divisions of EBL have achieved the globally 
recognized and coveted ISO 9001:2015 certification 
after fulfilling standard requirements for Quality 
Management Systems (QMS).

174Bank’s Risk Management Policy
It is imperative not only to meet regulatory requirements but also 
to enhance financial and operational performance of the bank. 
Consequently, the risk management policy has evolved into a 
pivotal component of the organizational structure, playing a crucial 
role in ensuring the long-term stability of banks. EBL maintains a comprehensive approach to risk management, with all risk-related 
activities guided by the comprehensive risk management policy of 
the bank, which provides a cohesive vision for the entire enterprise. 
This policy encompasses detailed guidelines for sound risk 
management, adhering to industry best practices at both national

EBL’s organizational structure follows the Three Lines of Defense (“3LoD”) model with a clear definition of roles and responsibilities for all 
risk types.
Lines of Defense Definition Key responsibilities include
The First Line of 
Defense (“First LoD”)Refers to those roles in the Bank whose 
activities generate risks, whether 
financial or non-financial, and who own 
and are accountable for these risks. 
Management control is the First LoD.• Identify and highlight the risks required to undertake revenue-
generating activities.
• Identify, assess, monitor and escalate risks and issues to the second 
line and senior management and promote a healthy risk culture.
• Manage risks within Risk Appetite, set and execute remediation plans 
and ensure compliance of regulatory requirements.
The Second Line of 
Defense (“Second LoD”)Refers to the roles in the Bank which 
define the risk management framework 
for specific risk types. Risk control 
and compliance oversight functions 
established by EBL management are the 
Second LoD.• Identify, monitor and escalate risks and issues to the Chief Risk Officer, 
senior management and the Board and promote a healthy risk culture.
• Oversee and challenge first-line risk-taking activities and review first-
line risk proposals.
• Propose Risk Appetite to the Board, monitor and report adherence to 
Risk Appetite and intervene to curtail business if it is not in line with 
existing or adjusted Risk Appetite, there is material non-compliance 
with policy requirements or when operational controls do not 
effectively manage risk.
• Ensure that there are appropriate controls to comply with applicable 
laws and regulations, and escalate significant non-compliance matters 
to senior management and the appropriate committees.
The Third Line of 
Defense (“Third LoD”)Refers to the Independent Internal Audit 
and Assurance, which is accountable 
for providing independent and objective 
assurance on the adequacy of the design, 
operating effectiveness and efficiency 
of the risk management system and 
systems of internal control.• Independently assess whether management has identified the key 
risks in the businesses and whether these are reported and governed 
in line with the established risk management processes.
• Independently assess the adequacy of the design of controls and their 
operating effectiveness.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk appetite & strategies
Risk appetite refers to the extent and nature of risk that an 
organization is willing to accept or pursue in order to achieve its 
goals, as well as those of its shareholders and other stakeholders.
EBL's risk appetite framework comprises a risk capacity, 
risk appetite statement, and key risk appetite measures. The implementation of the risk appetite statement and the 
monitoring of key risk appetite measures are instrumental 
in ensuring that the Bank operates within suitable risk 
thresholds. Furthermore, the Bank's credit risk appetite 
delineates its risk tolerance concerning lending activities, 
counterparty credit risk, and other credit exposures, including 
investments.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk Assessment, Monitoring and Reporting
Risk assessment and measurement
The Bank uses models for different purposes including estimating 
the value of transactions, measuring risk exposures, determining 
credit risk ratings and parameters, and calculating economic and 
regulatory capital. The use of quantitative risk methodologies and 
models is balanced by a strong governance framework and includes 
the application of sound and experienced judgment. 
Regular monitoring
The Bank ensures that business activities are within approved 
limits or guidelines, and are aligned with the Bank’s strategies 
and risk appetite. Breaches, if any, of these limits or guidelines are 
reported to senior management, risk committees, and/or the Board 
depending on the limit or guideline. Risk reports
Aggregate measures of risk across products and businesses are 
used in compliance with policies, limits, and guidelines. They also 
provide a clear statement of the amount, types, and sensitivity of the 
various risks in the Bank’s portfolio. Senior management and the 
Board use this information to understand the Bank’s risk profile and 
the performance of the portfolios.
Risk mitigation methodologies
Risk mitigation approach
The bank has implemented a robust strategy to mitigate risks, 
ensuring that risk exposures remain within acceptable limits. Risk 
mitigation measures are consistently applied in accordance with the 
Board-approved risk appetite in alignment with the bank's overall 
strategy. Standardized risk management practices are in place to 
foster accountability and provide essential oversight for effectively 
managing various types of risks.

Risk Management and Mitigation Tactics
Effective risk management relies on dynamic mitigation strategies 
that enhance organizational resilience. Risks with the potential 
to significantly impact business objectives must be proactively 
anticipated and addressed to safeguard long-term performance. 
Therefore, it is imperative to implement effective policies and action 
plans to ensure highly efficient risk management measures. In the banking sector, risk is inherent, making risk management crucial 
for financial stability. To adhere to regulatory standards and global 
best practices, EBL has developed risk mitigation strategies based 
on the policies and guidelines of Bangladesh Bank and its own risk 
appetite, limits, standards, reporting procedures, Key Risk Indicator 
(KRI), Management Action Trigger (MAT), and capital allocation in 
accordance with the Basel framework, including Stress Testing.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024181
RISK MANAGEMENT
Based on core risk guidelines, the bank has established various 
divisions to address specific risks, including the Credit Risk 
Management Division (CRMD), Credit Administration Department 
(CAD), Special Asset Management Division (SAMD), Internal Control 
and Compliance Division (ICCD), Anti-Money Laundering Department 
(ALMD), and Risk Management Division (RMD), among others. 
Additionally, to oversee overall risk management and ensure Basel 
III implementation, the bank has formed a Basel Implementation 
Unit. Moreover, it has instituted several high-powered committees 
to monitor and facilitate smooth risk management activities, such 
as ManCom, Extended Management Team (EMT), Asset Liability 
Committee (ALCO), Executive Risk Management Committee (ERMC), 
Supervisory Review Process (SRP) Team, Central Compliance 
Committee (CCC), and Credit Risk Management Committee (CRMC), 
among others.
Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the potential financial loss stemming from 
the default or decline in credit quality of a customer or other third party with whom EBL has a contractual obligation. It stands out as 
our foremost risk concerning exposure using maximum capital 
utilization.
To manage credit risk effectively, it is imperative to cultivate an 
appropriate credit risk culture. Annually, the Board of Directors, 
either directly or through the Risk Committee (of the Board), 
evaluates and endorses the bank's credit risk appetite, and every 
three years, reviews and sanctions the credit policy manual.
Approach to manage credit risk
EBL’s approach to managing credit risk involves establishing 
robust risk assessment processes, implementing prudent lending 
practices, and continuously monitoring borrower creditworthiness. 
Through comprehensive analysis and stringent controls, we aim 
to minimize credit losses and ensure the resilience of our loan 
portfolio. Additionally, proactive measures such as regular portfolio 
reviews and stress testing enable us to anticipate and mitigate 
potential risks effectively. The comprehensive assessment process 
adopted by CRM is outlined below:

Credit Risk Management Process
The credit risk management process involves a meticulous 
evaluation of borrower eligibility, creditworthiness, and risk profile. 
It begins with gathering comprehensive information about the 
applicant's financial status, business prospects, and collateral, followed by rigorous analysis to assess the potential risks and 
returns. Factors such as repayment capacity, collateral quality, and 
market conditions are carefully weighed to make informed lending 
decisions. Through prudent judgment and adherence to established 
criteria, we strive to ensure sound loan placements that align with 
our risk appetite and support sustainable growth.

182Credit Risk Mitigation Measurement
Credit risk mitigation is the process of assessing and managing 
the potential losses that may arise from the default of borrowers 
in the context of lending activities. In financial institutions, credit 
risk is a significant concern as it directly impacts the institution's 
profitability, stability, and ability to fulfill its obligations. Some of the 
effective credit risk mitigation measurements are:
Credit Assessment: EBL conducts thorough assessments of 
borrower creditworthiness, analyzing financial statements, cash 
flow projections, and market conditions to measure the likelihood 
of default. EBL ensures prudent lending decisions that mitigate 
potential credit losses.
Collateral Valuation: EBL meticulously evaluates the quality and 
value of collateral offered by borrowers, whether it's real estate, 
inventory, or securities. Through rigorous appraisal processes, 
market analysis and using third party collateral valuation firms, 
EBL assesses collateral adequacy to cover potential losses in the 
event of borrower default.
Portfolio Diversification: EBL prudently diversifies its loan portfolio 
across various sectors, industries, and geographic regions to 
mitigate concentration risk. By spreading risk exposures and 
balancing exposure to different segments, EBL reduces vulnerability 
to sector-specific downturns and economic shocks.
Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis: EBL conducts stress testing 
and scenario analysis to assess the resilience of its loan portfolio 
under adverse economic conditions. By simulating potential 
scenarios and evaluating their impact on credit risk exposures, EBL 
identifies vulnerabilities and strengthens risk mitigation strategies 
accordingly.
Regulatory Compliance: EBL adheres to regulatory guidelines and 
standards set forth by regulatory authorities, ensuring compliance 
with capital adequacy requirements, provisioning norms, and 
reporting standards. By maintaining regulatory compliance, EBL 
upholds its commitment to transparency, accountability, and sound 
governance practices.
Monitoring and Review: EBL employs a robust monitoring and 
review framework to continuously assess the effectiveness of its 
credit risk mitigation strategies. Through regular portfolio reviews, 
risk assessments, and performance monitoring, EBL identifies 
emerging risks and implements timely risk mitigation measures to 
preserve asset quality and profitability.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of loss from changes in market prices and 
rates (including interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign 
exchange rates and commodity prices), the correlations between 
them, and their levels of volatility. 
Approach to manage market risk
The Risk Management Division (RMD) and the Treasury Department 
of the Bank are entrusted with the responsibility of identifying, 
assessing, monitoring, controlling, and reporting on market risk. 
RMD oversees the Bank's overall risk parameters and exposures, 
providing reports to the Executive Risk Management Committee 
(ERMC).
The Treasury mid-office guideline contains the fundamental 
principles, functions, and duties of the mid-office. Mid office is 
responsible for scrutinizing and evaluating treasury transactions 
based on various risk factors including counterpart risk, individual dealer performance, dealing currency, tenor, timing of execution, 
and appropriateness of rate. Any significant findings resulting 
from this analysis are promptly brought to the attention of the 
appropriate authorities for notification and approval of exceptions, 
if any, on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.
Market Risk Management Process
EBL diligently monitors its exposures in capital markets, interest rates, 
and foreign exchange throughout the year. The Risk Management 
Committee (RMC) of the Board, Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO), 
and Executive Risk Management Committee (ERMC) proactively 
assess market dynamics and provide guidance to ensure the Bank 
remains resilient against adverse market conditions. The ultimate 
authority to establish market risk management strategy rests with 
the Board and its Risk Management Committee. Technical functions 
related to this strategy are delegated to the Assets & Liabilities 
Management Committee (ALCO), Executive Risk Management 
Committee, and Investment Committee. Collaboratively, the Asset-
Liability Management (ALM) Desk, Market Risk Management Desk, 
and Treasury Middle Office oversee the implementation of policies, 
procedures, and systems concerning financial models and risk 
management techniques. EBL adheres to its Foreign Exchange 
Risk Management Policy, Asset Liability Management Policy, and 
Investment Policy, all approved by the Board. These policies align 
with the Board-endorsed Market and Liquidity Risk Management 
Framework, Risk Management Guidelines, and other internal risk 
management protocols, collectively outlining the management 
approach towards market risk factors.
Market Risk Mitigation Measurement
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk of the Bank arises from adverse and unanticipated 
movements in future interest rates that could impact core business 
activities; granting of credit facilities, accepting deposits and issuing 
debt instruments, leading to fluctuations in earnings. 
The techniques for measuring Bank's interest rate risk exposure 
begin with a maturity/re-pricing  schedule  that  distributes  interest 
sensitive  assets,  liabilities,  and off-balance sheet positions  into 
a certain number of predefined time bands according  to their 
maturity (if  fixed rate) or time remaining to their next re-pricing 
(if  floating rate). 
Exchange rate risk
Exchange rate risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and 
capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. 
Banks foreign exchange risk may arise from following activities:
i. Holding foreign currency position in the banking book in the 
form of loans in foreign currency.
ii. Engaging in derivative transactions that are denominated in 
foreign currency for trading or hedging.
iii. Settlement risk due to default of counter parties.
iv. Time-zone risk, which arises out of time lags in settlement of 
one currency in one center and settlement of another currency 
in another center located at different time zone.
Bank’s foreign exchange risk management policies and procedure 
include:
i. Accounting and management information systems to measure 
and monitor foreign exchange positions, foreign exchange risk 
and foreign exchange gains or losses;

ii. Governing the management of foreign currency activities; and 
iii. Independent inspections or audits.
Foreign Exchange Value at Risk (VaR) is reviewed and revised to 
accommodate the changing market dynamics.
Investment portfolio risk
Bank holds investment portfolios to meet liquidity and statutory 
reserve requirements and for investment purposes. These portfolios 
expose the Bank to interest rate, foreign currency, credit spread and 
equity risks. These portfolios are controlled by a Board-approved 
policy and limits. 
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk management is a critical aspect of financial 
institutions' strategic planning, ensuring their ability to meet 
short-term financial obligations without compromising long-term 
viability. Liquidity risk refers to the potential for a bank to face 
difficulty in fulfilling immediate financial obligations. This typically 
arises from challenges in converting securities or tangible assets 
into cash without incurring losses in capital or income. This process 
involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential disruptions 
to a firm's ability to access sufficient liquidity. It is important to 
evaluate various factors, including cash flows, funding sources, 
and market conditions, to gauge potential liquidity gaps. Robust 
liquidity risk management involves establishing liquidity policies, 
stress testing scenarios, and defining risk tolerance thresholds. 
Additionally, diversification of funding sources, maintain ample 
liquid assets, and establish contingency plans to address unforeseen 
liquidity challenges are part of prudent liquidity management. The 
goal is to strike a balance between maintaining sufficient liquidity 
for day-to-day operations and optimizing the deployment of assets 
to generate returns. Continuous monitoring and periodic reviews of 
liquidity risk management strategies ensure adaptability to evolving market conditions and regulatory requirements, contributing to the 
overall resilience and stability of the financial institution. Effective 
management of liquidity and the balance sheet is imperative for the 
sustained viability of a bank. Furthermore, ensuring profitable and 
sustainable growth on the balance sheet is equally essential.
Approach to manage liquidity risk
Liquidity risk must be considered within the broader context of 
financial risk, as it is frequently intertwined with other financial risks 
such as investment risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange 
risk. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) assumes responsibility 
for overseeing the comprehensive balance sheet risk. The Treasury 
Division is charged with executing balance sheet management 
strategies aligned with ALCO's recommendations to mitigate risk 
and enhance returns. ALCO convenes regular meetings, typically 
at least once a month, to establish and evaluate Asset Liability 
Management (ALM) strategies.
Liquidity Risk Management Process
The Liquidity Risk Management Process at EBL (Eastern Bank PLC.) 
is meticulously structured to ensure the bank's resilience in meeting 
short-term financial obligations. EBL employs a comprehensive 
approach, integrating sophisticated risk assessment methodologies 
to identify, measure, monitor, and mitigate liquidity risks effectively. 
Through the diligent oversight of the Asset Liability Committee 
(ALCO), EBL evaluates the balance sheet regularly, aligning liquidity 
management strategies with the bank's overall risk appetite and 
regulatory requirements. The bank's Treasury Division plays a 
pivotal role in executing these strategies, closely coordinating with 
ALCO to optimize liquidity positions while maximizing returns. With 
a robust framework in place, EBL maintains a proactive stance in 
navigating dynamic market conditions, ensuring sustained liquidity 
and financial stability. The governing polices/ guidelines are:

Operational Risk
Operational risk covers a range of potential hazards, such as legal 
and regulatory exposures, challenges in business processes and 
adaptability, breaches of fiduciary duty or disclosure obligations, 
technological malfunctions, instances of financial misconduct, and 
environmental concerns. The ramifications of operational risks 
extend beyond mere financial losses to include regulatory penalties 
and reputational harm to the institution. In this context, EBL has 
demonstrated notable efficacy in mitigating operational risks, thereby 
safeguarding client assets and preserving shareholder interests.Approach to manage operational risk
Risk Management Division has implemented a comprehensive 
operational risk register, aligning its parameters with prevailing 
regulatory frameworks. This register serves as a repository for 
capturing operational risk exposures across the organization. The 
Risk Management team systematically gathers updates on risk 
status from relevant departments, consolidates this information, 
and evaluates risk performance, ensuring timely escalation of 
significant findings as warranted.

--- Page 186 ---
184Operational risk mitigation measurement
EBL employs a multi-layered approach to mitigate operational 
risks effectively. First and foremost, the bank maintains stringent 
adherence to legal and regulatory standards, ensuring compliance 
at every level of operation. Robust business processes are 
continually monitored and refined to enhance efficiency and 
resilience, minimizing the likelihood of disruptions. EBL places 
an utmost importance on transparency and accountability, with 
comprehensive compliance and monitoring teams in place to 
prevent breaches and uphold disclosure obligations. Additionally, 
the bank invests in technology and cybersecurity measures to 
preempt and address potential system failures or breaches. Through 
these proactive measures, EBL not only safeguards its assets and 
preserves shareholder value but also upholds its reputation as a 
trusted financial institution.
Other Risks
Reputational risk
Reputational risk refers to the potential for adverse effects on 
an organization's revenues, operations, or customer base due to 
negative publicity surrounding its conduct, business practices, or 
affiliations, regardless of their veracity. Such repercussions may 
necessitate costly litigation or defensive actions. Nonetheless, EBL 
is dedicated to safeguarding its fundamental values and mission. 
Presently, the external credit rating of EBL, losses stemming from 
internal and/or external fraud, defaults or delays in bill payments, 
and the quality of customer service are factors considered in 
evaluating the bank's exposure to reputational risk.
Environmental risk
Environmental risk pertains to the potential impact of environmental 
factors on the financial performance of the Bank. EBL's approach 
to addressing this issue is comprehensively detailed in its 
sustainability report, which provides a thorough examination of the 
measures undertaken to mitigate environmental risks and promote 
sustainable practices.
Strategic risk
Strategic risk includes the possibility that the Bank's business 
strategies may prove ineffective, inadequately executed, or 
insufficiently adaptable to evolving market conditions. EBL 
maintains that a prudent and proactive approach to managing 
strategic risks is essential for achieving superior outcomes and 
surpassing industry benchmarks in areas such as profitability, 
customer retention, and market penetration. Presently, the 
assessment of strategic risk at EBL includes factors such as the 
CAMELS rating, cost-to-income ratio, non-performing loan (NPL) 
ratio, recovery from classified loans within a year, annual loan 
write-offs, interest waivers, and a comparison of the base rate with 
lending rates. These metrics serve as valuable tools for evaluating 
the Bank's strategic resilience and effectiveness. 
Money laundering & terrorist financing risk
Money Laundering (ML) & Terrorist Financing (TF) risk refers to 
financial, reputational, operational, legal risk of bank resulting from 
being conduit of illicit fund/assets of perpetrators. Using bank to 
place illicit origin or ill motive of funds is the prime intention of 
perpetrators. Since they are adopting modern techniques to use 
financial channels as conduit of ML & TF, global financial channels 
are facing new challenges to ensure AML/CFT compliance. In compliance with timely initiative and instruction of regulators, 
we have strengthened AML/CFT compliance framework in EBL. 
Board of Directors & Top management has adopted “Zero Tolerance” 
stand against Money laundering & Terrorist Financing to set the 
tone at the Top. Central Compliance Committee (CCC) has been 
reconstructed with 14 crucial department/division heads so that 
they can actively contribute in AML/CFT compliance program. The 
committee reviews the emerging ML/TF risk issues and provides 
guidance on next course of action in quarterly meetings. DMD & 
Chief Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Officer (CAMLCO) is 
leading a dedicated AML Department consisting of 13 employees to 
address AML/CFT issues centrally in Head Office. AML Department is 
continuously monitoring transactions to identify unusual/suspicious 
transactions and ensure meticulous reporting to BFIU as and when 
required. In addition to nominating Branch Anti-Money Laundering 
Compliance Officer (BAMLCO) at 85 branches, we have nominated 
Department Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Officer (DAMLCO) 
at 26 crucial departments to oversee AML/CFT compliance. EBL 
has implemented automated transaction monitoring and sanction 
screening system to corroborate AML/CFT compliance program. 
As a result of deploying adequate resource in technology and 
skilled manpower, suspicious transactions/activities identification, 
escalation, and reporting has been improved significantly. In 
aspiration to improve further and continue development programs, 
EBL has adopted awareness programs such as need based training, 
foundation trainings, certification programs etc. for its employees.
Information and communication technology (ICT) 
risk 
Effective ICT risk management has become essential for EBL as 
we rely increasingly on technology to achieve the organizational 
objective. As the risks emerge in tandem with technological 
advancements, ICT security efforts need to be strengthened to 
ensure appropriate security controls are in place to maintain 
integrity, confidentiality and availability of information. EBL is 
committed to protect customer information and assets from any 
type of unauthorized use and/or fraud. 
Disclosure of Risk Reporting
Effective risk management is fundamental to achieving 
organizational objectives and maintaining financial resilience in 
the banking sector. Bangladesh Bank has identified six core risk 
areas for banks and issued comprehensive policy directives to 
promote sound risk management practices across the industry. 
In adherence to these regulatory guidelines, EBL has developed 
customized strategies to address key risk categories, including 
investment risk, market risk, operational risk, and liquidity risk. 
To support ongoing oversight and informed decision-making, EBL 
prepares risk management reports on a regular basis—monthly, 
quarterly, semi-annually, and annually.
Stress Testing Report
Stress test serves as a tool to evaluate the susceptibility of the bank 
to unforeseen yet possible shifts in various relevant factors, such as 
an escalation in non-performing loans, alterations in profit rates, or 
declines in the value of securities. The ramifications of this model 
are quantified by the resultant alterations in the overall Capital 
to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of the bank. The regulatory 
authority, the Central Bank, has mandated that all banks undertake 
stress testing on a quarterly frequency. Subsequent to review by 
senior management and the Board, the findings of the stress testing 
exercise are required to be submitted to Bangladesh Bank.

188Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk represents the potential for a bank to incur losses due 
to either its incapacity to fulfill financial obligations promptly or to 
expand its asset base without incurring undesirable costs or losses.
Key Liquidity Ratios at a glance
Liquid Assets to Short Term Liabilities
To calculate liquid asset to short term deposit, cash in hand, balance 
with Bangladesh Bank, other banks & financial institutions, money 
at call and investment (Government) are considered as liquid assets. 
To calculate short term liabilities those which will be maturing 
within 3 months are considered.
The average Liquid asset to short term liabilities ratio was about 95 
% in 2024.
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
LCR aims  to  ensure  that  a  bank  maintains  an  adequate  level  of  
unencumbered,  high -quality  liquid  assets  that  can  be  converted  
into  cash  to meet  its  liquidity  needs  for  30  calendar  days. 
Liquidity Coverage ratio is calculated as per format provided by 
Bangladesh Bank. Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)
NSFR aims to limit over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding 
during times of abundant market liquidity and encourage better 
assessment of liquidity risk across all on- and off-balance sheet 
items. This ratio is part of BASEL III liquidity parameters and 
calculated on central bank’s guidelines and methodologies. 
The average NSFR for 2024 was 114.64%, exceeding the required 
threshold of 100%. 
Maximum Cumulative Outflow (MCO)
MCO represents the proportion of total liabilities that could 
potentially be withdrawn at once by depositors or creditors. A higher 
MCO ratio indicates a greater ability to meet short-term obligations 
without facing liquidity constraints, which is favorable for stability 
and financial health. However, excessively high MCO ratios may 
also signify underutilized capital or overly conservative investment 
strategies, potentially impacting long-term profitability. Thus, 
finding the right balance in managing the MCO ratio is crucial for 
financial institutions to navigate effectively through various market 
conditions while maintaining liquidity and maximizing returns. Ratios 2024 2023

Operational Risk
Operational risk covers a range of potential hazards, such as legal 
and regulatory exposures, challenges in business processes and 
adaptability, breaches of fiduciary duty or disclosure obligations, 
technological malfunctions, instances of financial misconduct, and 
environmental concerns. The ramifications of operational risks 
extend beyond mere financial losses to include regulatory penalties

Planning, Strategy & Governance
The department of Governance under Planning, Strategy and Governance in EBL is designed on the basis of controlling risks along with a 
knowledge of governance to manage them effectively. As the Three Lines of Defense functions hand in hand simultaneously with Governance, 
the structure of this department includes them altogether to ensure a robust risk culture throughout the bank.

To ensure good governance, EBL focuses on managing and controlling the Operational Risks to enhance operational quality and efficiency. 
The aim of identifying and managing the risk factors of banking applications are achieved through following the steps mentioned below:
• Governance has provided the business and support units a clear and precise list of functions along with their risk weightage 
upon non-compliance in excel based template, also known as Risk Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) tool.
• The quantifying tool is focused to conduct a regular self-monitoring of tasks under different units/ departments in a division.
• RCSA is formulated to help minimizing the emergence of colossal risks from operational activities.Governance delegates responsibilities and provides guideline to Business and Support Units for achieving the objectives of the 
organization while ensuring legal, regulatory, and ethical expectations are met. 
Overseeing an independent, objective, and competent Internal Audit function to provide clarity and confidence on progress toward 
the achievement of objectives.
• After the Second Line of Defense, Internal Audit will provide valuable input to the responsible persons for operational risk 
management, but should not have direct operational risk management responsibilities.
• While monitoring and auditing independently, the similarities and deviations from prepared checklists and practices would be 
clear and it will be vital to certify the full-bodied compliance culture in the bank.

Reporting & Compliance
Aggregate risk measures, covering products and business lines, 
are employed in adherence to established policies, limits, and 
guidelines. These measures offer a transparent representation of 
the magnitudes, ranges, and sensitivities of various risks inherent 
in the bank’s portfolios. Senior management and the Board utilize 
this data to grasp the bank’s risk profile and evaluate portfolio 
performance. Consequently, the bank submitted the ensuing risk

Recovery Plan
EBL established a recovery planning framework to implement 
recovery and resolution planning for the Bank in line with the 
directives of Bangladesh Bank. The Recovery Plan seeks to put in 
place an effective and efficient processes to enhance recoverability 
and resolvability of EBL in stressed or crisis situations. 
The Recovery Plan serves as a strategic planning tool that – 
Integrates the recovery planning with the existing risk governance 
framework and reinforces risk management functions.
Strengthens EBL’s internal arrangements to recover from a 
range of stressed events.
The Recovery Plan is an overarching framework that has been 
developed, maintained, and when necessary, to be executed by EBL 
to manage severe stress events that threaten to undermine the 
Bank’s viability. As part of recovery planning, EBL has identified and 
planned for the execution of a suite of recovery options to restore 
long-term viability under a range of idiosyncratic and system-wide

that a recovery plan is capable of being executed in an effective and 
efficient manner.
Going forward the bank will continue to integrate the recovery 
plan with existing risk appetite and risk management frameworks. 
EBL is ensuring that the recovery plan is complementary and 
closely linked to the bank’s strategic and contingency planning 
and promote understanding of, and involvement in, the recovery 
planning process, at all relevant levels across the organization, 
including internal teams tasked with making decisions during 
stressed events. The Recovery Plan has been aligned with ICAAP , 
Business Continuity Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Capital Growth

192Capital Planning
Unlike a non-lending business entity, a bank’s capital in isolation says little about its solvency unless assessed in relation to the risk profile 
of its loans and investments. Capital planning, therefore, is all about structuring these portfolios (in terms of size and risk) in such a way that 
the planned capital can provide a sufficient cushion for key stakeholders. Assessing regulatory capital against a bank’s overall risk exposures 
is a comprehensive and integrated process.
At EBL, business growth dictates capital planning. Our capital position is intrinsically linked to all risk-taking activities. In short, ‘capital 
planning’ at EBL, revolves around managing the ‘Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio or CRAR’. Rather than raising capital as a reactive 
measure to weak risk controls, we focus on strong risk management and control practices.
EBL has been generating most of its incremental capital through retained earnings (stock dividend and statutory reserve transfer), 
supplemented by occasional issuance of subordinated debt and rights share to support Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) growth.
Importance of capital planning
Development of strategic plan
Capital plan acts as a key input while making strategic choices to ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to support growth initiatives, 
enter new markets, and invest in technology and innovation.
Setting risk parameters
It enables EBL to assess and manage various risks, including credit, market, and operational risks, by maintaining an appropriate capital 
buffer to absorb potential losses.
Factors considered in capital planning
Strategic plan
Aligning capital growth plan with the bank's 
long-term strategic goals. 
Financial goals/ aspirations
Ensuring planned capital level supports desired business growth 
and proﬁtability to meet shareholders expectations.
Addressing shock scenarios
Regular assessment of capital adequacy based on stress 
scenarios helps EBL  prepare better for any unforeseen shocks.
Capital mix
Optimizing the capital structure by balancing equity, 
debt and other instruments to minimize cost of capital.
Regulation on Dividend policy
Level of CRAR plays a key role in dividend decisions taken by banks. Impact 
of dividend decisions and shareholders expectations are considered.
Customers’ credit rating
Pursuing eligible customers to do credit rating which eventually helps EBL 
to reduce overall risk-weighted assets and capital requirements.Regulatory requirements

RISK MANAGEMENT
Relationship between strong capital base and corporate governance
We believe that a strong capital base and effective corporate governance are intricately linked, laying the foundation of a resilient and 
trustworthy financial institution. A robust capital base provides EBL the financial cushion necessary to absorb unexpected losses and 
enhances the ability to withstand economic downturns and other adverse events. This, in turn, reinforces investors’ confidence and ensures 
sustainable growth. A strong capital base also enables EBL to comply with regulatory requirements, demonstrating its commitment to sound 
financial management and risk mitigation. 
On the other hand, effective corporate governance mechanisms manifested through transparent decision-making process, accountability, 
and ethical practices, are essential for maintaining the integrity and upholding the reputation. By promoting transparency and accountability, 
corporate governance inspires trust among stakeholders, including investors, customers, and regulators, thereby protecting EBL’s reputation 
and enhancing access to capital markets.
5-Year progression of capital and CRAR (Bank)
Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR)
MCR serves as a foundation to ensure the stability and resilience of financial institutions. Comprising three vital components—credit risk, 
market risk, and operational risk—MCR acts as a safeguard against potential threats to a bank’s solvency and overall financial health.
Credit risk
Credit risk, the first component, covers the potential for loss arising from borrowers’ failure to meet their financial obligations. EBL assesses 
credit risk meticulously, evaluating factors such as borrower creditworthiness, collateral quality, and economic conditions to mitigate 
potential losses.
Market risk
Market risk, the second component, arises from fluctuations in market prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity 
prices. EBL has implemented global best practices and risk management techniques to mitigate market risk, ensuring they can weather 
volatile market conditions without compromising their stability.
Operational risk
Operational risk, the third component, relates to the potential loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external 
events. This includes errors, fraud, system failures, and legal risks. Robust operational risk management frameworks are essential for banks 
to identify, assess, and mitigate operational risks effectively.
Supervisory Review Process (SRP)
The Supervisory Review Process, a pivotal element of Risk-Based Capital Adequacy Framework, ensures that banks maintain adequate 
capital to cover inherent risks (other than credit, market and operational ones) and promote enhanced risk management practices. EBL 
implemented an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) policy, delineating capital calculation methodology and departmental 
roles under pillar II, aligning with SRP principles to assess and manage diverse risks effectively. Following risks are considered under SRP:Particulars 20242023

RISK MANAGEMENT
Disclosures on Risk Based Capital (Basel III)
Background 
BASEL accords are the basis of Capital Adequacy guidelines which 
provide global regulatory framework for management of risk and 
capital. These are the internationally accepted capital adequacy 
standards issued by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS) housed at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) 
situated in the BASEL City of Switzerland. Basel III reforms are the 
response of BCBS to improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb 
shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the 
source, and reduce the risk of spillover from financial sector to real 
economy. Basel III mainly addresses the following areas:
• raise the quality and level of capital to ensure that banks are 
better able to absorb losses both as a going concern and a gone 
concern.
• increase the risk coverage of the capital framework.
• introduce leverage ratio to serve as a backstop to the risk-
based capital measure.
• raise the standards of supervisory review process (Pillar 2) and 
public disclosures (Pillar 3) etc.
In compliance with the ‘Revised Guidelines on Risk Based Capital 
Adequacy (RBCA)’ issued by Bangladesh Bank in December 2014, 
banks in Bangladesh have formally entered into Basel III regime 
from 1 January 2015. The new capital and liquidity standards have 
greater business implications for banks. Eastern Bank PLC. (EBL) 
has adopted Basel III framework as part of its capital management 
strategy in line with the revised guideline. These Market discipline 
disclosures under Basel III are made following the same guidelines 
in order to complement the minimum capital requirements and 
the supervisory review process. Establishing a transparent and 
disciplined financial market through providing accurate and timely 
information related to liquidity, solvency, performance and risk 
profile of a bank is another important objective of this disclosure. 
Consistency and validation
The quantitative disclosures are made on the basis of consolidated 
audited financial statements of EBL and its subsidiaries as at 
and for the year ended 31 December 2024. Those are prepared 
under relevant International Accounting and Financial Reporting 
Standards and related circulars/instructions issued by Bangladesh 
Bank from time to time. The assets, liabilities, revenues and 
expenses of the subsidiaries are combined with those of the parent 
company (EBL), eliminating intercompany transactions. Assets 
of the subsidiaries are risk weighted and equities of subsidiaries 
are crossed out with the investment of EBL while consolidating. 
So, information presented in the ‘Quantitative Disclosures’ section 
can easily be verified and validated with corresponding information 
presented in the consolidated and separate audited financial 
statements of EBL (Group and Bank) available on the website of the 
Bank (www.ebl.com.bd). The report is prepared once a year and is 
available in the website.A. Scope of application

C. Capital Adequacy
Qualitative Disclosures
(a) A summary discussion of the bank’s approach in assessing the 
adequacy of its capital to support current and future activities.
Assessing regulatory capital in relation to overall risk exposures of 
a bank is an integrated and comprehensive process. EBL follows the ‘asset based’ rather than ‘capital based’ approach in assessing 
the adequacy of capital to support current and projected business 
activities. The Bank focuses on strengthening risk management and 
control environment instead of increasing capital to cover up weak 
risk management and control practices. EBL has been generating 
most of its incremental capital from retained profit (stock dividend and 
statutory reserve transfer etc.) and occasional issue of subordinated 
debt and right shares to support incremental growth of Risk Weighted 
Assets (RWA). Besides meeting regulatory capital requirement, the 
Bank maintains adequate capital to absorb material risks foreseen. 
Therefore, the Bank’s Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) 
remains consistently above regulatory requirements during 2024 
(14% plus). The surplus capital maintained by EBL will act as a buffer 
to absorb all material risks and to support the future activities. To 
ensure the adequacy of capital to support the future activities, the 
bank assesses capital requirements periodically considering future 
business growth. Risk Management Division (RMD) under guidance 
of the SRP team/ERMC (Executive Risk Management Committee), 
takes active measures to identify, quantify, manage and monitor all 
risks to which the Bank is exposed to.

(a) General Disclosure
Credit risk is defined as the probability of failure of counterparty 
to meet its obligation as per agreed terms. Banks are very much 
prone to credit risk due to its core activities i.e. lending to Corporate, 
Retail & SME, other banks/FIs. The main objective of credit risk 
management is to minimize negative impact through adopting 
proper mitigates and to limit risk exposures within acceptable limit.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Credit risk management has been independent of origination 
of business functions to establish better control and to reduce 
conflicts of interest. The Head of Credit Risk Management (HoCRM) 
has well-defined responsibility for management of credit risk. Final 
authority and responsibility for all activities that expose the bank 
to credit risk rests with the Board of Directors. The Board however 
delegated authority to the Managing Director or other officers of the 
credit risk management division. 
The Board of Directors (BoD) sets credit policies and delegates 
authority to the management for setting procedures, which together 
has structured the credit risk management framework in the bank. The Credit Policy Manual contains the core principles for identifying, 
measuring, approving, and managing credit risk in the bank and is 
designed to meet the organizational requirements that exist today 
as well as to provide flexibility for future. These policies represent 
the minimum standards for credit extension by the bank, and are 
not a substitute of experience and good judgment.
Definitions of past due and impaired credit: 
To define past due and impairment through classification and 
provisioning, the bank follows Bangladesh Bank Circulars and 
Guidelines as summarized below:

Differentiation between holdings on which capital gains are expected 
and those taken under other objectives including for relationship and 
strategic reasons
Investment in equity securities by EBL is broadly categorized 
into two types: Quoted securities (Ordinary shares, Mutual Funds) 
and Un-quoted securities (including Equity shares, Unit funds 
and Preference shares). Investment into Quoted equity securities 
are generally held for trading to generate both capital gains and 
dividend income. Investment into Unquoted equity securities are 
usually made for good potentials and strategic reasons, while also 
generating dividend income.

Qualitative Disclosures
(a) General Disclosure
Interest Rate Risk is the risk which affects the Bank’s financial 
condition due to change of market interest rates. Changes in interest 
rates affect both the current earnings (earnings perspective) and 
also the net worth of the Bank (economic value perspective). Bank 
assesses the interest rate risk both in earning and economic value 
perspective.
The bank's interest rate risk management process encompasses 
defining business objectives, forecasting future macroeconomic 
variables, and comprehending the money markets and debt 
markets in which it operates. Additionally, it involves assessing the 
bank's comfort level with market risk and quantifying its appetite 
accordingly.
The Bank uses the following approach to manage interest rate risks 
inherent in the Balance sheet:
Simple Gap Analysis: Traditional Gap analysis of on-balance sheet 
Asset Liability Management (ALM) involves careful allocation of 
assets and liabilities according to re-pricing/maturity buckets. This 
approach quantifies the potential change in net interest income 
using a specified shift in interest rates, e.g. 100 or 200 basis points, 
or a simulated future path of interest rates.
Assumptions: For Gap analysis, bank considers the following:
• For fixed-rate contract, remaining maturity is considered.
• For contracts with provision of re-pricing, time remaining for 
next re-pricing is considered.• For assets and liabilities which lack definitive re-pricing 
interval or for which there is no stated maturity, bank 
determines the core and volatile portion. For assets, volatile 
portion is bucketed up to 3 months using historical repayment 
behavior and stable portion is bucketed in 6-12 months. 
For liabilities, volatile portion is bucketed up to 1 year using 
historical withdrawal behavior and stable portion is bucketed 
in over 1 year segment.
• Deposits that are already matured but not withdrawn yet are 
considered to fall under overnight bucket. 
Also, following assumptions are met:
• The main assumption of gap analysis is that interest rate 
moves on a parallel fashion. In reality however, it doesn’t. 
• Contractual repayment schedule is met.
• Re-pricing of assets and liabilities takes place in the midpoint 
of time bucket.
• The expectation that loan payment will occur in schedule.
• No early encashment is considered in term and recurring 
deposit.
• Non maturity deposit withdrawal is considered based on past 
withdrawal behavior. 
• Interest paid on liabilities tend to move faster than interest 
rates earned on assets.
• Interest rate attached to bank assets and liabilities do not move 
at the same speed as market interest rates do.
• Point at which some assets and liabilities are re-priced is not 
easy to identify.

Duration GAP Analysis: 
Duration GAP Analysis primarily aims to assess a bank's vulnerability 
to interest rate fluctuations by measuring the sensitivity of its 
Market Value of Equity (MVE). It evaluates how changes in interest 
rates affect the MVE and can be utilized to gauge the impact on the 
bank's equity value across various interest rate scenarios. ALCO 
regularly monitors the Leveraged Liability Duration and overall 
duration gap of the bank's balance sheet on a quarterly basis to 
evaluate the repercussions of parallel shifts in the assumed yield 
curve.

G. Market Risk
Qualitative Disclosures
Market Risk: Market Risk refers to potential loss that can occur as 
a result of fluctuations in market conditions. It encompasses the 
risk of adverse impacts on the value of both on and off-balance 
sheet positions due to changes in equity prices, interest rates, and 
currency exchange rates. Our aim with respect to market risk is 
to strike a balance between risks and return that is optimal, while 
also fulfilling the needs of our customers, through our policies and 
procedures.
The primary categories of market risk for the bank are:
Interest rate risk: Arising from changes in yield curves, credit 
spreads and implied volatilities on interest rate options.
Currency exchange rate risk: Arising from changes in exchange 
rates and implied volatilities on foreign exchange options.
Equity price risk: Arising from changes in the prices of equities, 
equity indices, equity baskets and implied volatilities on related 
options.
Bank has a comprehensive Treasury Trading Policy, Asset-Liability 
Management Policy, Investment Policy approved by the BoD to 
assess, monitor and manage all the above market risks. Various 
internal limits have been set to monitor market risk and capital 
requirement is assessed as per standardized approach of Basel III. 
Methods used to measure Market Risk: Bank applies maturity 
method in measuring interest rate risk in respect of securities in 
trading book. The capital charge for entire market risk exposure 
is computed under the standardized approach using the maturity 
method and in accordance with the guideline issued by Bangladesh 
Bank.
Market Risk Management System: The ALCO regularly monitors a 
number of ratios to manage the interest rate risk, with key ratios 
such as Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio 
(NSFR), Maximum Cumulative Outflow (MCO), Liquid asset to total 
assets, Volatile liability dependency ratio, Snap liquidity ratio and 
Short term borrowing to Liquid assets ratio. Additionally, the ALCO 
also regularly tracks the interest rate sensitive gap and duration 
gap of the total portfolio.
To manage foreign exchange risk of the bank, the bank has adopted 
the limit set by central bank to monitor foreign exchange open 
positions. Foreign exchange risk is computed on the sum of net 
short positions or net long positions, whichever is higher. FX VaR of 
December 2024 end are as follows:Amount in BDT

H. Operational Risk
Qualitative Disclosures
Operational Risk: Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from 
fraud, unauthorized activities, error, omission, inefficiency, 
systems failure or external events. It is inherent in every financial 
organization and covers a wide spectrum of issues. We seek to 
minimize exposure to operational risk, subject to cost benefit trade-
offs. 
Views of Board on system to reduce Operational Risk: The policy 
for measuring and managing operational risks is approved by the 
Board in line with the relevant guidelines of Bangladesh Bank. Audit 
Committee of the Board directly oversees the activities of Internal 
Control and Compliance Division to protect against all operational 
risks. As a part of continued surveillance, the management 
committee (MANCOM), Executive Risk Management Committee 
(ERMC), Monitoring department (ICCD) and Risk Management 
Division (RMD) regularly review different aspects of operational 
risks and escalate the findings to appropriate authority while 
internal audit suggests formulating appropriate policies, tools & 
techniques for mitigation of operational risk of the bank.
Policies and processes to mitigate operational risk: The bank 
captures some identified risk events associated with all functional 
departments of the bank through standard reporting format, 
Departmental Control Function Check List (DCFCL), Quarterly 
Operation Report (QOR), Key Risk Indicator (KRI), internal audit, 
monitoring, and system check etc. Internal Control and Compliance 
Division (ICCD) is detecting ‘High’ Risk areas and finding mitigation 
of those risks. ERMC also oversees the operational risk issues. 
ERMC analyzes ‘high’ and ‘moderate’ risk indicators and sets 
responsibility for specific people to resolve the issues.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Performance gap of executives and staffs: EBL is an equal 
opportunity employer. It recognizes the importance of having the 
right people at right positions to achieve organizational goals. Our 
recruitment and selection is governed by the philosophy of fairness, 
transparency and diversity. Understanding what is working well and 
what requires further improvement is essential to our performance 
management system. The performance management process aims 
to clarify what is expected from employees as well as how it is to be 
achieved.
Our learning and development strategy puts special focus on 
continuous professional development to strengthen individuals’ 
skill set by removing weaknesses to perform the assigned job with 
perfection. We have a wide range of internal and external training 
programs, awareness programs and time to time communications 
from senior management to enhance capabilities as well as 
minimize performance gap that will contribute more to bottom line. 
Peoples’ performance is assessed on the bases of performance 
objectives and key performance indicators (KPI) set at the beginning 
of each year. Decisions related to rewards and recognitions for the 
employees are taken on the bases of how well the assigned KPIs are 
met by the employee.
Potential external events: The overall environment within which 
a bank operates creates certain externalities which could affect 
business performance directly such as:
Fraud Risk is the risk of incurring losses as a result of an intentional 
act or omission by a third party involving dishonesty, for personal 
and/or business gain, to avoid personal and/or business loss, or to 
conceal improper or unauthorized activity. This includes facilitation, 
misrepresentation, money laundering, terrorist financing, theft, 
forgery and cybercrime.  
Business Continuity Risk is the risk of incurring losses resulting 
from the interruption of normal business activities, i.e. interruptions 
to our infrastructure as well as to the infrastructure that supports 
our businesses. 
Information Security Risk is the risk of an event which could result in 
the compromise of organizational assets, including, but not limited 
to, unauthorized use, loss, damage, disclosure or modification of 
organization assets. It includes the risk of cyber threats on the 
organization. 
Regulatory Compliance Risk is the risk of attracting regulatory 
sanctions (including restrictions on business activities, fines or 
enhanced reporting requirements), financial and/or reputational 
damage arising from our failure to comply with applicable laws, 
rules and regulations. 
Vendor Risk arises from adverse events and risk concentrations 
due to failure in right vendor selection, insufficient controls and 
oversight over a vendor and/or services provided by a vendor and 
other impacts to the vendor itself.
Approach for calculating capital charge for operational risk: The 
bank applies ‘Basic Indicator Approach’ of Basel III as prescribed 
by BB in revised RBCA guidelines. Under this approach, banks have 
to calculate average annual gross income (GI) of last three years 
and multiply the result by 15% to determine required capital charge. 
Gross Income is the sum of ‘Net Interest Income’ and ‘Net non-interest income’ of a year or ‘Total Operating Income’ of the bank 
with some adjustments as noted below. GI shall:
• Be gross of any provision (e.g. for unpaid interest),
• Be gross of operating expenses, including fees paid to 
outsourcing service providers,
• Include lost interest i.e. interest suspense on classified loans 
(SS, DF, BL).

I) Liquidity Ratio
Qualitative Disclosures
Views of BoD on system to reduce liquidity risk
Liquidity Risk is the risk of bank’s inability to repay its obligations 
as they fall due or incurring excessive cost while mobilizing fund 
due to scarcity of cash fund at a certain period of time. The risk 
arises from mismatch in the expected level of cash flows from 
maturing assets and liabilities. The intensity and sophistication 
of liquidity risk management system depends on the nature, size 
and complexity of a bank’s activities. Sound methods in measuring, 
monitoring and controlling liquidity risk is critical to sustainability 
of the bank. Therefore, The Board of Directors of the bank sets 
policy, different liquidity ratio limits, and risk appetite for liquidity 
risk management.
Methods used to measure liquidity risk
The tools and procedures deployed by EBL to manage liquidity risk 
are comprehensive. The measurement tools used to assess liquidity 
risks are: 
• Statutory Liquidity Requirement (SLR)
• Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
• Advance to Deposit Ratio (ADR)
• Structural Liquidity Profile (SLP)
• Maximum Cumulative Outflow (MCO)
• Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
• Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)
• Volatile Liability Dependency Ratio
• Liquid Asset to Total Deposit Ratio
• Liquid Asset to Short Term Liabilities
Liquidity risk management system
Responsibility of managing liquidity lies with Asset Liability 
Committee (ALCO) of the bank which meets at least once in 
every month. Asset and Liability Management (ALM) desk closely 
monitors and controls liquidity requirements on a daily basis by 
proper coordination of funding activities. A monthly projection of 
fund flows is reviewed in ALCO meeting regularly.

--- Page 206 ---
204Policies and processes for mitigating liquidity risk
In order to develop comprehensive liquidity risk management 
framework, EBL has constructed Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) 
to manage liquidity in both normal and stressed conditions. CFP 
includes a set of policies and procedures that serves as a blueprint 
for the bank to meet its funding needs in a timely manner and 
at a reasonable cost. CFP is an extension of ongoing liquidity 
management while ensuring:
• Reasonable liquid assets are maintained;
• Measurement and projection of funding requirements in 
different scenarios; and
• Management of access to funding sources.
Maturity bucket of cash inflows and outflows is an effective tool to 
determine bank’s cash position; that estimates cash inflows and 
outflows with net deficit or surplus (GAP) both on a day to day basis 
and over a series of specified time periods. A bucket wise (e.g. call, 
2-7 days, 8 days-1 month, 1-3 months, 3-12 months,  1-5  years,  over  
5  years)  maturity  profile  of  the  assets  and  liabilities is prepared 
to understand  mismatch in every bucket.  A structural maturity 
ladder or profile is prepared periodically following guidelines of the 
Bangladesh Bank.

Qualitative Disclosures
Views of BoD on system to reduce excessive leverage
Leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total on and off-balance 
sheet exposures. It was introduced into the Basel III framework as 
a non-risk based backstop limit, to supplement risk-based capital 
requirements. EBL has embraced this ratio along with Basel III 
guideline as a credible supplementary measure to risk based 
capital requirement and to assess the ratio periodically.
Policies and processes for managing excessive on and off-balance 
sheet leverage
Revised RBCA guideline of Basel III issued by BRPD of Bangladesh 
Bank is followed by EBL while managing excessive on and off-
balance sheet leverage of the bank. As per RBCA guideline, leverage 
ratio indicates Tier I Capital divided by Total Exposure after related 
deductions.Approach for calculating exposure
The Bank has calculated the regulatory leverage ratio as per the 
guideline of Basel III. The numerator, capital measure, is calculated 
using the definition of Tier I capital applicable from 01 January 2015. 
The denominator, exposure measure, is calculated on the basis of 
the Basel III leverage ratio framework as adopted by Bangladesh 
Bank.

b) Information relating to the design and structure of 
remuneration processes.
An overview of the key features and objectives of remuneration 
policy
Remuneration policy of the bank has been framed to maintain a 
performance based reward policy which recognizes the contribution 
of each of the employees of the bank. EBL’s reward package consists 
of the following key elements:
Fixed pay:
The purpose of fixed pay is to attract and retain employees by 
paying competitive pay for the role, skills and experience required 
for the business. This includes salary, fixed pay allowance, and 
other allowances. These payments are fixed and do not vary with 
performance.
Benefits:
EBL provides benefits in accordance with local market practice. 
This includes subsidized loans (car, house building), hospital bill 
reimbursement, critical allowance support, TA/DA etc. 
Annual Incentives:
EBL provides annual incentives to drive and reward performance 
based on annual financial and non-financial measures consistent 
with the medium to long-term strategy, shareholder interest and 
adherence to EBL values. 
Regulations of Pay and Allowances 
• Salaries are confidential between the concerned employees 
and Human Resources Division.
• The grade-wise scale of pay and other allowances of employees 
are determined by the competent authority from time to time. 
• Salary revision is decided by the Managing Director with the 
approval of the Board of Directors based on:
a. Individual Performance
b. Market movement

are remunerated independently of the businesses they oversee.
EBL ensures that Risk and Compliance employees are remunerated 
independently as the remuneration package is set by the 
management and applicable for all employees irrespective of 
profession or area. 
C) Description of the ways in which current and future risks are 
taken into account in the remuneration processes.
An overview of the key risks that the bank takes into account when 
implementing remuneration measures.
In a highly competitive financial sector like banking, remuneration 
system is mostly dictated by market forces. Demands for efficient 
and skilled employees tend to increase as disproportionate number 
of financial institutions chase them. As a result, compensation 
package for skilled resources is relatively high and salary revision 
takes place more frequently than other industries. Excessive 
turnover of human resources, skill shortage, inability to attract and 
retain good people are some of the risks banks have to consider. 
However, EBL designed its remuneration package as per market 
driven strategy to ensure right package for the right people. On 
top of it, in designing remuneration package, EBL ensures fair 
treatment, internal equity and external competitiveness to retain 
good resources. 
An overview of the nature and type of the key measures used to take 
account of these risks; including risks difficult to measure (values 
need not be disclosed).
Market survey is conducted periodically to compensate employees 
for their expertise, time, mental and social engagement with the 
organization.
A discussion of the ways in which these measures affect remuneration.
These measures ensure that the remuneration process of EBL is:
• Right employees are getting right package as per their 
performance, quality of experience, training received and 
special expertise.
• Ensure internal equity & external parity
A discussion of how the nature and type of these measures has 
changed over the past year and reasons for the change, as well as the 
impact of changes on remuneration.
EBL has remained consistent in the measures through which

deviation as compared to last year. 
(d) Description of the ways in which the bank seeks to link 
performance during a performance measurement period with 
different levels of remuneration.
An overview of main performance metrics for bank, top-level business 
lines and individuals.
At EBL, salary increment and promotion is purely linked with 
performance. As per policy, performance evaluation is done for all 
permanent employees. In addition to yearly review of performance, 
a quarterly review is also carried out. Performance evaluation is 
done on the below parameter:
• Business Objectives

RISK MANAGEMENT
Management of Non-Performing Loan (NPL)
Industry overview
Bangladesh’s banking sector has long been grappling with rising 
Non-Performing Loan (NPL), a key concern for both banks and 
the regulator, striving to maintain a sustainable growth in quality 
loan portfolio. However, this balance has become increasingly 
difficult amid economic challenges, governance concerns, liquidity 
constraints, and heightened competition, which have led to several 
banks adopting aggressive lending practices. External economic 
shocks and market uncertainties have further compounded these 
challenges.
Bangladesh’s import dependence exposed banks to persistent 
exchange rate volatility - particularly the continuous depreciation 
of the Taka - straining import payments and affecting vulnerable 
industries. Weak governance in some banks worsened the situation, 
while broader uncertainty, marked by strikes, protests, and policy 
shifts disrupted business activity. Amid shifting political and 
regulatory dynamics, confidence in the financial system remained 
fragile, prompting businesses to adopt a cautious investment 
stance.
Despite regulatory interventions, the banking sector’s non-
performing loan (NPL) ratio surged to 20.20% by December 2024, 
up from 16.93% in September. Correspondingly, the volume of 
classified loans increased sharply to around BDT 3.45 trillion, 
rising from BDT 2.45 trillion just three months earlier. This steep 
escalation underscores mounting stress in the sector—one that may 
be even more pronounced when factoring in rescheduled loans, 
disputed accounts under litigation, and written-off exposures.
With an aim to support banks in curbing NPL growth, the 
government introduced measures such as revised loan classification 
guidelines, an updated loan write-off policy allowing banks to 
expedite the process within two years instead of three for more 
efficient balance sheet management, and a  renewed regulatory 
focus on strengthening recovery frameworks, credit discipline, and 
institutional governance.
Additionally, stricter monitoring frameworks and compliance 
mechanisms were implemented to curb loan evergreening practices 
through rescheduling multiple times, along with taskforces to 
address structural banking challenges and enhance financial 
stability. While stricter classification may temporarily raise NPLs, 
these steps aim to create a more structured and transparent 
loan portfolio in the long run. Despite ongoing challenges, 
strict compliance, enhanced transparency, and proactive risk 
management have enabled several banks to contain NPLs within 
manageable levels.
Strategic focus in 2024
• Asset quality remained central to the Bank’s credit philosophy 
in 2024 and will continue to be a priority in the years ahead.
• Emphasis was placed on interim monitoring with rigorous 
portfolio follow-up to mitigate credit deterioration risks amid 
rising NPL and evolving socio-economic conditions.
• Strategic focus was directed toward Green and Sustainable 
Financing, aligning with Bangladesh Bank’s policy framework.
• The Bank maintained a dynamic and responsive credit risk 
management approach, ensuring adaptability  to shifting EBL’s commitment to superior asset quality is a testament to its 
resilience amid economic challenges. In 2024, the Bank closed the 
year with a Gross NPL ratio of 3.34%, significantly outperforming the 
industry average, where the ratio stood at 20.20% as of December 
2024. From 2020 to 2024, EBL consistently maintained a lower NPL 
ratio, reflecting disciplined risk management and asset quality.
Despite external economic pressures causing the Gross NPL ratio 
to rise from 3.10% to 3.34%, EBL’s rigorous credit assessment, 
proactive monitoring, and focused recovery strategies have kept it 
ahead of industry trends. A diversified client base has also shielded 
the Bank from the effects of global and local economic downturns, 
ensuring portfolio stability.
Even with an industry-wide rise in NPL, EBL has maintained 
a remarkably low NPL ratio, demonstrating its strong risk 
management culture. This success reflects a coordinated effort 
across EBL’s business units, credit risk management teams, special 
asset management teams, senior management, and the Board of 
Directors. Such a cohesive approach reinforces EBL’s position 
as a leader in sustainable banking practices, ensuring long-term 
financial stability in an increasingly complex environment.
Movement of provisions made against NPLeconomic and business conditions while accommodating 
changing business needs.
• Credit decision-making was streamlined - without 
compromising analytical depth - through an efficient work 
process system, reinforced by the ISO Certification for the 
Credit Risk Management division.

2082025: navigating a complex economic terrain
As Bangladesh steps into 2025, it faces a phase of economic 
recalibration driven by political transition and global market 
shifts. With reforms aimed at attracting foreign investment, 
enhancing labor standards, and strengthening trade partnerships, 
the government seeks to fortify economic stability amid lingering 
macroeconomic uncertainties. 
The RMG sector, a cornerstone of Bangladesh’s export economy, 
continues to struggle with a multitude of challenges. Frequent labor 
unrest, factory shutdowns, and vandalisms have severely disrupted 
production – leading international buyers to cancel or delay orders 
–  undermining the sector's recovery and global competitiveness.
The energy sector remains a bottleneck, restricting industrial 
production and escalating operational costs, further fueling 
inflationary pressures on both consumers and businesses. The 
persistent interplay between energy shortages and industrial 
slowdowns poses further threat to economic growth. Policy 
uncertainties, shifting trade dynamics, and potential commodity 
price surges also present ongoing risks. However, there is still 
room for hope as stronger growth in major global economies could 
revitalize regional demand and economic momentum.
In line with broader fiscal policy efforts to expand the tax base and 
enhance revenue generation, VAT and taxes have been increased across multiple sectors. In response, manufacturing industries are 
adapting by implementing efficiency-driven strategies to maintain 
competitiveness. Sectors such as motorcycles, refrigerators, and 
air-conditioners are focusing on operational improvements to 
offset rising costs, aiming to stimulate industrial activity, attract 
foreign investment, and drive economic growth. Similarly, SMEs 
are exploring adaptive strategies and operational efficiencies to 
overcome financial constraints, and strengthen their contribution 
to the economy. 
While RMG remains Bangladesh’s primary export, diversifying 
into pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, agriculture and 
agri-business, electronics, ceramics etc. will help reduce risks and 
broaden the country’s export base. In the coming years, a renewed 
focus on sustainable and green financing, as well as climate 
financing will be crucial to ensuring long-term financial viability 
for both banks and the economy.
The banking sector is bracing for pivotal changes with the 
expected overhaul of loan classification criteria by mid-2025. This 
adjustment is expected to significantly increase NPL, necessitating 
higher provisioning and tightening liquidity. The subsequent credit 
crunch may result in elevated borrowing costs and hinder business 
expansion. However, these measures aim to instill disciplined 
lending practices, enhance financial governance, and ultimately 
fortify the banking sector, laying the groundwork for long-term 
economic stability and growth.NPL management: our guiding principles

Recovery of Classified & Written off Loans
Industry overview and status of EBL
The growing burden of classified and written off loans has put 
Bangladesh’s banking sector under mounting pressure, making 
recovery efforts more critical than ever. The scale of the challenge 
is stark – non-performing loan (NPL) has reached alarming levels. 
This rise highlights deep-rooted deficiencies in governance, credit 
assessment, and regulatory oversight within the banking industry. 
While NPL is a global concern, Bangladesh’s persistently high NPL 
ratio – far exceeding international best practices – underscore the 
sector’s structural vulnerabilities.
In response, Bangladesh Bank has intensified its efforts to 
strengthen recovery mechanisms, forming task forces, proposing 
stricter legal frameworks under the forthcoming Bank Resolution 
Act and tightening loan classification rules. The effectiveness 
of these measures will ultimately depend on their execution. 
Without rigorous enforcement, improved credit discipline, and a 
commitment to responsible lending, the sector risks remaining 
trapped in a cycle of defaults and write-offs.
Despite industry-wide challenges, EBL remains persistent in its 
commitment to maintaining a resilient financial position. Over 
the past year, the Bank has made significant strides in managing 
NPL and strengthening asset quality, reinforcing its reputation 
for sound risk management and prudent lending. As part of its 
strategy to ensure financial stability, improve profitability, and drive sustainable growth, EBL has implemented a structured and 
proactive approach to reduce default risks. This commitment is 
reflected in its NPL ratio of 3.34% in Dec’24 - one of the lowest in the 
industry. By maintaining stringent credit assessment protocols and 
an active recovery framework, EBL has successfully differentiated 
itself in the industry, positioning the Bank as a frontrunner in 
responsible banking practices.
Strategic focus in 2024
• Digitalization and automation for better loan recovery through 
introduction of digital platforms for borrower engagement and 
automated collection processes to streamline and improve 
efficiency.
• Proactive monitoring and early intervention with real-time 
loan tracking, dedicated early warning systems and cross-
department collaboration to mitigate risks before they escalate.
• Strengthening collections and recovery mechanisms through 
proactive debt collection strategies and legal enforcement to 
improve repayment rates.
• Leveraging technology for better risk assessment and recovery.
• Collaboration with Bangladesh Bank and regulatory authorities 
to align recovery efforts with industry best practices and policy 
frameworks.
Key initiatives in 2024
• Taking a multi-faceted approach that combines regulatory 
measures, targeted sector support, legal reforms, and 
innovative recovery practices.
• Formation of Special Write off Recovery Unit as per Bangladesh 
Bank circular.
• Formation of centralized and dedicated Legal Affairs Division 
as per Bangladesh Bank circular to strengthen recovery efforts.
• Regular Portfolio analysis meeting with Business and CRM for 
improving quality of asset portfolio & providing feedback to 
underwriting team based on collection efforts.• Fostering loan recovery through incentivize by campaign.
• Obtain travel restriction against the defaulting borrowers and 
order of attachment over unencumbered properties of the 
defaulting borrower.
• Strengthening legal framework through fast-track legal 
processes & seamless coordination with Bank’s panel lawyers 
towards faster case disposal.
• Keeping proper coordination with law enforcement agencies 
to execute court order which eventually helps to increase 
recovery.Performance highlights 2024

Business model’s adaptability to change for 
achieving the strategic objectives
The business model of EBL includes the transformation of inputs 
of six capitals into values that have positive or negative impact on 
the stakeholders. Our strategies were divided into three separate 
periods, and resource allocation plans and KPIs were designed 
to achieve these strategies. Our business model is inherently 
adaptable to future changes in regulatory requirements, the digital 
landscape, socio-political environment, global and local economies, 
and organizational structures. And according to the changes, our 
resource allocation plan is realigned to meet the set objectives.
Influence of external environments on the 
strategy and resource allocation plan
As EBL operates within a dynamic financial landscape, changes 
in the external environment inevitably influence the organization, 
thereby impacting our strategic objectives and resource allocation 
plans. The impact of external environment on EBL and our response 
is discussed in PESTEL (page 250). In response to these changes, 
we realign our strategic objectives and resource allocation plans 
accordingly.
Moreover, the Bank has identified key risk areas—including credit 
risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, environmental risk, strategic 
risk, and reputational risk—which have significant implications 
across the six capitals. These risks are continuously assessed 
and managed to safeguard value creation in both the short and 
long term. The impact of these risks and how they are managed is 
discussed in Six capital on page 222.
Competitive advantage of EBL
Role of innovation
EBL encourages innovation across all levels of the organization 
which is reflected in our endeavors. We have empowered our teams 
to identify opportunities to increase operational efficiency, improve 
risk management practices, and introduce new financial products 
tailored to cater diverse market segments. This innovation-led 
approach not only strengthens EBL’s market position but also 
contributes to long-term value creation for stakeholders. Some of 
our notable achievements for continuous efforts are as follows:
• In-house developed EBL Skybanking app.
• Launched Smart IVR system
• Improved EBL Self-Service Hub
• Enhancement of e-KYC module• New payment service solutions for International Banking 
(OBU) clients
Enhancement and strategic utilization of 
Intellectual Capital
EBL recognizes intellectual capital which comprises of employee 
knowledge, professional experience, governance culture, risk 
management practices, innovation and organizational work culture 
that creates positive value. The Bank actively develops this capital 
by investing in training, leadership development, digitalization and 
creating governance culture to enhance employee competencies as 
well as establishing our brand as reputable financial organization 
in the market.
To strategically exploit this capital, EBL integrates its intellectual 
resources into core business processes, digital innovation, and 
customer service excellence. Moreover, the Bank systematically 
captures institutional knowledge through robust knowledge 
management systems, ensuring its effective application across the 
organization. This approach not only supports EBL’s strategic goals 
but also strengthens its competitive advantage in an increasingly 
knowledge-driven financial sector. More on intellectual capital can 
be found at page 218.
Integration of Environmental and Social 
Considerations into Strategy
EBL has embedded environmental and social considerations into its 
strategic framework and work flow, recognizing their critical role in 
driving sustainable growth and long-term competitive advantage. 
The Bank integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
factors into decision-making processes, risk assessments, and 
product development which is aligned with global best practices 
and stakeholder expectations. EBL’s commitment to environmental 
sustainability is reflected in its adoption of green banking practices, 
financing of eco-friendly projects, and operational initiatives aimed 
at reducing the Bank’s carbon footprint. Details of our environmental 
initiatives can be found under Sustainability Report at page 257.
On the social front, EBL believes to invest in community development 
that has positive impact. As a responsible and socially conscious 
organization, we invest in initiatives that promote education and 
skill development for underprivileged communities, empower 
women, provide healthcare support to those in need, and contribute 
to creating a positive environmental impact. More on our community 
development projects can be found under CSR at page 257.
By aligning our strategic objectives with environmental and social 
priorities, we not only mitigate long-term risks but also differentiate 
us in the market as a forward-thinking, values-driven organization.

218Strategic Framework
Deposit related strategy
EBL has established itself as a trusted financial institution 
consistently maintaining a robust market position with a steady 
and growing deposit portfolio. Through the implementation of 
effective strategies, we have successfully built strong relationships 
with new customers while retaining the trust of our existing clients. 
These initiatives not only ensure liquidity but also enable efficient 
management of deposit costs, contributing to sustained profitability 
and growth. 
Offering diversified products
By evaluating the existing deposit portfolio and market dynamics, 
we make strategic decisions to grow specific types of deposits, such 
as current, savings, term deposit accounts. To achieve these goals, 
we offer a diversified range of products complemented by special 
propositions throughout the year. Leveraging data-driven customer 
analysis, we design these products to address the unique financial 
needs of our customers with accuracy and care.
Offering competitive deposit rates 
To attract deposit customers and maintain a competitive edge in the 
industry, we regularly review and adjust our deposit rates across 
various product categories. In setting or realigning these rates, 
we carefully consider market trends, liquidity management, and 
associated risks, ensuring our offerings remain both attractive and 
sustainable.
Enhancing digital services for seamless banking 
We are continuously enhancing our digital services to enable 
customers to perform routine banking tasks without visiting 
branches. Key initiatives include opening savings, current, fixed 
deposit, or recurring deposit accounts through the EBL Self-
Service Portal, making instant fund transfers to any bank account, 
scheduling future transfers, and downloading account statements 
via EBL Skybanking. Through our digital advancements, we aim 
to make branches as paperless as possible, delivering service 
excellence while upholding EBL’s commitment to green initiatives.
Expanding into the rural area through strategic 
resource allocation 
To grow our deposit customer base nationwide, we have been 
increasing our presence in rural areas by establishing sub-branches 
and agent outlets. By strategically allocating infrastructure and 
manpower, we aim to effectively mobilize deposits from these 
regions, fostering financial inclusion and strengthening our 
nationwide footprint.
Exploring new market to tap into potential clients 
We are committed to expanding our reach into untapped markets 
with significant potential by leveraging insights from market 
trends and emerging opportunities. As part of this strategy, we are 
focusing on segments such as university and college students, non-
resident Bangladeshis, freelancers. By setting clear short-term and 
long-term objectives, we aim to strategically explore these markets, onboard new customers, and broaden our client base for sustained 
growth.
Nurturing accounts
At EBL, every customer matters. While we focus on expanding our 
deposit base, we remain committed to nurturing accounts, turning 
them into growth opportunities. Through real-time monitoring 
and personalized outreach via SMS, email, and calls, we re-engage 
dormant accounts and address their financial needs. This strategy 
not only strengthens relationships but also drives sustainable 
deposit growth, reflecting our dedication to long-term value creation.
Strengthening customer relationships through 
cross-selling 
By offering a comprehensive suite of banking services and engaging 
in strategic network-building activities, we establish meaningful 
relationships with our customers. Leveraging these connections, we 
provide tailored product propositions that align with their specific 
needs. Through this approach, we cater to our retail, corporate, 
and SME clients with deposit products designed to support their 
financial goals while driving steady growth in our deposit portfolio.
Enhancing cash management solution 
Corporate customers constitute a significant portion of our clientele, 
demanding seamless and efficient banking services. To meet their 
unique needs, we offer tailored cash management solutions that 
streamline their payables and receivables processes. By aligning 
our services with their operational demands, we aim to foster 
long-term partnerships while growing our deposit portfolio and 
reinforcing our commitment to excellence in corporate banking.
Focusing on foreign currency deposit portfolio 
To address the recent foreign currency crisis in the banking sector, 
we have focused on clients who can ensure a steady flow of foreign 
currency deposits over the long term. To expand our FCY portfolio, 
we offer competitive rates, a seamless account opening process, 
and dedicated relationship management services.
In 2024 we introduced offshore banking deposit products to attract 
foreign and non-resident customers. In 2025, we will forge new 
partnerships with organizations working with NRBs and launch 
campaigns featuring special propositions to onboard new clients. 
Strengthening relationship through customer 
engagement activities 
By analyzing customer behavior and trends, we design targeted 
engagement activities through digital channels i.e. Facebook, email, 
sms. Additionally, we host annual customer events and campaigns 
to nurture long-term, meaningful relationships. Our aim is to 
expand these initiatives to strengthen our market presence and 
grow our customer base.

INTEGRATED REPORTING
Supporting inclusive growth though Financial 
Inclusion initiatives 
To support the government’s inclusive growth perspective and 
reach the underserved and unbanked population of the country, we 
have been working as per the policy of Bangladesh Bank since its 
inception. Some of the initiatives include opening no-frill accounts 
(10 Taka) for low-income groups, school banking accounts and 
campaigns, agent banking operations, arranging financial literacy 
programs and so on. These activities will continue in future, ensuring 
our active participation in Bangladesh’s inclusive growth journey.
Promoting financial awareness activities 
We, at EBL, are committed to our customers’ financial well-being. To 
empower them to make informed decisions, we maintain consistent 
communication through email, mobile app notifications, newspaper 
advertisements, brochures, and social media platforms. Additionally, 
we organize interactive discussion sessions to highlight the benefits 
of various deposit products and services. 
To deepen their understanding of financial products, digital 
banking solutions, new offerings, and financial security, we 
strategically leverage digital platforms and host targeted events. 
These initiatives are designed not only to educate but also to foster 
trust and engagement, creating a financially literate and proactive 
customer base. Through integrating financial awareness into our 
broader strategy, we aim to drive steady deposit growth while 
supporting our digital transformation journey.
Loan & advance related strategy 
At EBL, every loan tells a story - of growth, resilience, and trust. Our 
lending strategy is not about building numbers; it is about creating 
ever-lasting value. In a world that constantly evolves, we focus 
on what remains constant: understanding needs of customers, 
managing risks, and building relationships that evolve and grow.
Strategic focus on export-oriented lending
EBL prioritizes clients with a balanced focus on both export and 
import activities, with strategic emphasis on export-oriented 
businesses. This approach aligns with national economic priorities 
& achieving positive balance of trade, while maintaining prudence in 
lending to large manufacturing clients under the corporate segment. 
Our strategy supports high-growth sectors such as RMG, Textiles, 
and other export-driven industries, reinforcing EBL’s position as a 
key financial partner for Bangladesh’s industrial advancement. We 
will introduce industry-specific financial products tailored to the 
unique needs of export-oriented businesses to foster growth and 
stability.
Digitalization for seamless customer experience
Our strategy prioritizes investment in advanced digital technologies 
to enhance the efficiency of the customer lending experience. By 
streamlining the credit approval process, minimizing paperwork, and 
embedding automation, we aim to create a more agile and efficient 
system that is both simpler and faster. This strategic direction is 
designed to reduce turnaround time, enhance operational efficiency, 
and deliver a borrowing experience defined by speed, precision, and 
simplicity. EBL is exploring the option of creating user-friendly digital 
lending platform to provide corporate customers with real-time 
access to loan information and status updates.Proactive risk management with early warnings
EBL’s early warning system identifies potential risks at the earliest 
stages. This proactive approach ensures timely interventions, 
mitigates credit risk, and safeguards asset quality, aligning with 
global best practices. It is particularly crucial for managing large 
corporate exposures, where early detection of vulnerabilities plays a 
vital role in maintaining a healthy loan book. 
Data-driven decision making
At EBL, advanced analytics and data-driven insights form the 
cornerstone of our approach to credit assessment and portfolio 
management. We are developing a centralized database to integrate 
borrower profiles, historical financial data, and creditworthiness 
metrics. This initiative will enable deeper analysis of risk indicators, 
portfolio performance, and approval patterns, while also providing 
predictive insights and early warnings. 
Regional credit hubs for enhanced efficiency
To streamline loan processing and improve turnaround times, EBL 
has established regional credit hubs across key zones. These hubs 
bring decision-making closer to the regions we serve, ensuring 
faster approvals, enhanced operational efficiency, and consistent 
credit quality. By decentralizing loan processing, we have 
strengthened risk management practices in our lending portfolio. 
Sectoral diversification for stability
EBL’s lending strategy emphasizes sectoral diversification as a key 
driver of portfolio stability and risk mitigation. In 2025 & beyond, 
our approach will focus on maintaining balanced credit exposure 
across core industries such as RMG, Textiles, Pharmaceuticals, 
Leather, Footwear, and essential items industries. By fostering a 
well-distributed portfolio, we aim to build greater resilience against 
economic fluctuations. This strategic direction ensures sustainable 
growth while supporting Bangladesh’s evolving industrial 
landscape and broaden EBL’s horizon of potential customers. 
We continuously monitor industry trends and adjust our sectoral 
exposure to capitalize on emerging opportunities.
Financing import substitutes
EBL is prioritizing industries that offer viable alternatives to 
import-dependent materials. This strategic focus reduces import 
reliance, strengthens local supply chains, and supports economic 
sustainability while fostering innovation and growth. 
Sustainable financing for a greener future
Sustainability is one of the core pillars of EBL’s lending strategy. 
By financing businesses that adopt eco-friendly practices, we 
align with Bangladesh Bank’s vision for a greener economy while 
unlocking growth opportunities in green industries. In 2024, 
we disbursed 89.48% of total finance as Sustainable Finance - 
significantly exceeding the regulatory requirement of 20%. This 
approach reflects our commitment to responsible growth, value 
creation, and a sustainable future.

--- Page 222 ---
220Green financing
EBL’s Green Financing strategy is guided by a vision for a more 
sustainable future. We prioritize financing projects that contribute 
to a greener economy, including Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs), 
renewable energy, waste management, energy efficiency, alternative 
energy, and other environmentally sustainable initiatives. In 2024, 
35.24% of our total term loan finance was directed towards Green 
Financing - significantly surpassing the regulatory target of 5% - 
embedding sustainability into our core lending philosophy.
This strategy is further reinforced by a thoughtful realignment of 
our sectoral exposure. We are adopting a more balanced approach 
towards high-carbon industries such as power, and steel. This shift 
reflects our alignment with Bangladesh Bank’s sustainable finance 
philosophy, enabling EBL to drive long-term value creation and 
support Bangladesh’s transition to a greener economy.
Cross-selling for deeper engagement
By leveraging personalized insights and targeted cross-selling 
strategies, EBL strengthens relationships with its existing 
customers. Through complementary products and services, we 
create a holistic financial ecosystem that adds value for our clients 
and drives deeper engagement. 
Customer-centric solutions
Understanding the unique financial needs of diverse customer 
segments is central to EBL’s approach. From tailored repayment 
structures and flexible terms to customized loan solutions, we 
empower businesses and individuals to achieve their financial 
goals. This includes sector-specific support for high-priority 
industries such as RMG, export-oriented businesses, and SMEs. 
Empowering women entrepreneurs
EBL remains committed to bridging the gender gap in business 
financing. By offering gender-specific loan products with competitive 
rates, flexible terms, and simplified access, we empower women 
entrepreneurs, driving inclusion and fostering economic progress.
Empowering SME growth
SMEs form the backbone of Bangladesh’s economy, and EBL is 
committed to their growth aspirations. Simplified processes, 
targeted advisory services, and customer education ensure that 
SMEs thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape.
Export & Import related strategy
Export strategy
EBL’s export strategy emphasizes growth, diversification, 
sustainability and resilience. By leveraging technology, 
strengthening global partnerships, and adhering to regulatory 
frameworks, we empower exporters to thrive in competitive 
international markets while effectively addressing local demands.
Regulatory compliance: building confidence
In compliance with Bangladesh Bank guidelines, EBL offers a 
structured and reliable trade framework that fosters confidence in 
cross-border transactions. We also advise customers on compliance 
with international trade laws, export documentation, and sanctioned 
country regulations to prevent issues that may arise in cross-border trade. On periodic basis, we arrange workshops on international 
trade compliance and documentation for employees and customers 
to keep them updated.
Foreign currency hedging: mitigating market risks
We offer tailored foreign exchange hedging solutions, including 
forward contracts and options to protect exporters from currency 
fluctuations. This ensures stability and profitability for customers 
in volatile markets. 
Digitalized solutions for export efficiency
EBL simplifies the export process through digitized platforms, 
enabling faster issuance, processing, and settlement of trade 
transactions. This enhances operational efficiency and ensures 
exporters can swiftly meet global demands. 
Empowering sector leaders
Ready-Made Garments & Apparel Industry remains central to 
Bangladesh’s export portfolio, and EBL prioritizes this sector to 
uphold the country’s strong global positioning. Simultaneously, we 
support exports in chemicals, medicine, footwear, and ICT, fostering 
growth across industries.
Supporting local and global export synergies
While foreign exports are central, EBL recognizes the importance of 
local exports in sectors like Non RMG and chemicals. This balanced 
approach ensures a robust export ecosystem catering to domestic 
and international markets. 
Access to government backed financing programs 
EBL supports businesses by facilitating access to low cost 
government-backed refinance loans for financing trade activities, 
such as purchasing machinery for export production or financing 
the import of raw materials. i.e. Export Development Fund (EDF) 
Loan, Long Term Financing Facilities (LTFF), Green Transformation 
Fund (GTF). 
Driving sustainability in export practices
By helping exporters to access Bangladesh Bank’s Green 
Transformation Fund (GTF) which is given for importing capital 
machinery and accessories for environment-friendly initiatives, 
EBL supports environmentally conscious exporters. This aligns with 
global sustainability trends and enhances Bangladesh’s reputation 
as a responsible trade partner. 
Supporting innovation-driven export growth
Recognizing the potential of ICT exports, EBL facilitates trade 
in technology-driven sectors, paving the way for Bangladesh to 
become a significant player in the global digital economy. 
Enhancing regulatory and compliance assistance
EBL provides advisory services to ensure exporters comply with 
country regulations, international trade laws and documentation 
standards. This proactive approach minimizes risks, fostering 
smooth and efficient export operations. To provide instant support, 
we have a plan to establish a dedicated helpline for real-time 
compliance support.

Import strategy
With a view to address the shifting needs of industries, leveraging 
global partnerships, and embedding sustainability into the core, 
EBL facilitates more than the movement of goods. This approach 
strengthens businesses, sharpens Bangladesh’s competitive edge, 
and builds an economy ready to weather tomorrow’s uncertainties.
Regulatory compliance
Complying Bangladesh Bank’s guidelines form the cornerstone 
of our import strategy. By ensuring unified compliance through 
the facilitation of Letters of Credit (LCs) at prescribed margins, 
EBL provides businesses with a secure and reliable framework 
for engaging in international trade. We regularly arrange training 
sessions for the customers on regulatory changes and updates.
Global banking network
Leveraging a robust correspondent banking network, EBL facilitates 
smooth cross-border trade financing. To enable import transactions 
across multiple currencies, we have streamlined our operations and 
enhanced connectivity for clients in an ever-evolving global trade 
landscape. 
Customizing LC solutions to drive resilience
EBL’s tailored LC solutions adapt to dynamic market conditions, 
supporting seasonal fluctuations and diverse import needs. This 
ensures stability and agility for businesses in key sectors. 
Prioritizing high impact industries
By supporting imports critical to Bangladesh’s growth trajectory, 
EBL finances key sectors such as textiles, manufacturing, and infrastructure. Our focus on fabrics and cotton strengthens the RMG 
industry, while machinery imports drive industrial modernization. 
Digital transformation for import efficiency
Harnessing technology, EBL has streamlined LC issuance, 
processing, and settlement through digitized trade finance 
solutions, ensuring faster responses and reducing operational 
friction for clients.
Promoting sustainable industrial practices
EBL facilitates the import of scrap metal and vessels, aligning 
with global recycling initiatives to foster a circular economy. This 
underscores our commitment to industrial sustainability. 
Facilitating food security and consumer demand
By financing imports of essential consumer goods and edible 
oils, EBL bridges gaps in domestic production. This ensures the 
consistent availability of vital goods while supporting the aspirations 
of an expanding middle class. In coming days, we want to explore 
collaborations with local agro-based industries to boost domestic 
production alongside imports.
Adaptability to seasonal trends
Understanding the cyclical nature of trade, EBL calibrates its 
financing solutions to align with peak periods, enabling businesses 
to capitalize on market opportunities while maintaining stability 
during slower seasons.

Financial capital
Financial capital refers to the pool of funds available to a bank for creating value for its stakeholders. 
It is an integral component for ensuring seamless operation of business activities. Generally, for 
a bank, the financial capital consists of shareholder’s equity, borrowing from external sources 
and customer deposit. The effective management of these funds helps an organization to grow 
profitably.  
Through optimal utilization and effective management of financial capital, EBL has 
consistently created value for stakeholders. Our financial capital consists of customers 
deposit, borrowing from banks and FIs and shareholders equity. The mix is as follows:Material topics:
• Sound financial 
performance
• Quality asset portfolio
• Low-cost fund
• Sustainable financing
• Managing liquidity 
mismatch
Impact on other 
capitals
The use of manufactured, 
human, and intellectual 
capitals may reduce 
financial capital in the short 
term but boosts long-term 
financial growth.

Challenges faced in 2024
Initiatives taken by EBL in 2024
• The overall banking sector faced liquidity stress due to the 
loss of customer’s trust in general.
• The rise in NPL in the industry has impact on overall 
profitability of the banking sector.
• The cost of fund management through other financial 
institution was higher in 2024.
• To manage the liquidity stress, we leveraged our brand 
reputation which helped us gain customer confidence 
resulting in increase in the deposit.
• To manage bank’s overall NPL, we focused on providing 
loan to the good borrowers through strict screening process.
Associated risks & risk management practices
Credit and liquidity risks are critical in the banking sector, and managing these risks ensures a bank’s stability. Financial capital is used for providing 
loan & advances and following two risks are prominent under this capital component. 
Credit Risk
At EBL, credit risk is meticulously managed in accordance with our credit policy manual, credit instruction manual, and defined risk appetite. 
Establishing a strong credit risk culture is essential for ensuring effective management of credit risk within the organization. Details of credit 
management practice can be found at page 181.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from the inability to meet short-term financial obligations to borrowers and depositors. To manage this risk, various 
indicators are closely monitored, and appropriate actions are taken as needed. Additionally, we have a Contingency Funding Plan (CFP)—a 
comprehensive set of policies and procedures—that provides guidance for addressing funding requirements in such situations. Details of 
liquidity management practice can be found at page 183.

Customer deposits have increased by 25.02% in 2024, primarily driven 
by a “flight to quality,” where depositors from poorly governed banks 
shifted their funds to more reputable institutions. Our long-standing 
commitment to good governance practices and a strong compliance 
culture has gained customer confidence that contributed to this 
growth at EBL. This increase highlights the significant role of sound 
governance for maintaining long-term relationships and cultivating 
customer loyalty, even amid economic uncertainties.
Our borrowings from financial institutions have remained stable 
throughout the year, with a notable increase of 10.46% in 2024. This 
growth reflects our robust financial position and the continued trust 
lenders place in our business. Additionally, our shareholders’ equity, the 
smallest component of our financial capital, has risen by 14.88%.
Effective management of our financial capital has positively influenced 
our financial performance. Net interest income increased by 29.91% in 
2024, primarily due to the removal of the interest rate cap, the SMART 
rate. Operating income also saw a rise of 29.71%, largely driven by the 
growth in net interest income. As a result, profit after tax (PAT) recorded 
a significant increase of 22.83%.
• To strengthen the asset portfolio, we will diversify our customer base and make lending decision following our risk management framework.
• Manage the liquidity flow of the bank through minimizing cost of fund and maturity gap of asset and liabilities.
• Maintain good rapport with the DFIs and financial institutions to avail funds at lower cost.Way forward

Impact on other 
capitals
Investing in manufactured 
capital may negatively 
impact financial capital in 
the short term, especially 
as we enhance digital 
services. 
However, these investments 
will have long-term 
benefits, increasing 
financial capital, enriching 
intellectual capital, 
retaining skilled talent, and 
strengthening social and 
relationship capital. 
Therefore, mindful 
investment in 
manufactured capital is 
crucial.Manufactured capital
Bank’s physical & digital infrastructure that help to provide services to the customers are 
represented as the manufactured capital. The manufactured capital of a bank consists of all the 
customer touch points-both physical and digital such as branches, sub-branches, agent outlets, 
ATMs, CRM, POS etc.
To increase customer’s reach and to make banking services available to the customers in a 
convenient way, investment in manufactured capital is necessary. It is particularly important to 
strategically invest in this infrastructure to make banking services accessible to the unbanked 
segments of the economy.
Physical network
To effectively cover key locations across Bangladesh, we have strategically expanded our physical 
network, which includes 85 full-service branches, 45 sub-branches, and 118 agent banking 
outlets nationwide, offering a wide range of comprehensive banking services to our customers. 
We have also included Islamic Banking window at 20 branches out of 85 branches.
Digital network
Expanding our customer reach through a digital network is one of our key strategies to ensure the 
availability of banking services 24/7. In 2024, we have upgraded the Skybanking app, enhanced 
the EBL Self-Service Hub, improved the EBL Skypay gateway, and optimized EBL Connect. We 
have made services available for Non-Resident Bangladeshis (NRBs) from anywhere in the world 
to easily connect with EBL and access a range of banking services to fulfill their financial needs.
Phygital (physical+digital) network
EBL has increased its footprint to the customers through phygital services that provide banking 
services to them without putting step to branch and wait in line. With 245 ATMs, 108 CRMs, and 
33 RTDM services nationwide, customers can access over-the-counter banking through these 
convenient touch points.
Challenges faced in 2024
Initiatives taken by EBL in 2024
• Due to high administrative cost, we did 
not increase our branches.
• We also introduced NRB customer on-
boarding through EBL self-service hub 
which was challenging to incorporate 
due to the nature of the customer 
segment.
• Cyber security and data security is a 
persistent threat to Banks and financial 
institutions.
• To utilize our resources effectively in 
expanding channels, we have shifted 
our focus on expansion to sub-branches 
& agent outlets for reaching areas that 
have few branch banking activities.
• After identifying key issues, we 
upgraded EBL Self-service hub which 
enabled NRB customers to open savings, 
term and recurring deposits.
• We always give highest priority to cyber 
security and data security. Our prompt 
activities have resulted in minimizing 
such threats.SDG relevance

CHATTOGRAMOperational risk
Manufactured capital is subject to operational risks such as technology failures and potential regulatory breaches if there is any lapse in 
regulatory compliance during branch expansions. EBL has established comprehensive guidelines to mitigate such operational risks. 
Additionally, our risk management team closely monitors these risks and escalates issues as necessary to ensure proactive management and 
compliance.
Environmental risk
During business expansion, environmental risks are associated with the use of manufactured capital. The expansion of our physical network 
necessitates the consumption of land, water, and fuel. Therefore, EBL adopts a mindful approach to branch expansion where we prioritize 
sustainable growth over the aggressive expansion strategies often observed in the banking industry.
Strategic risk
It is important to note that if the strategies implemented to expand manufactured capital do not yield long-term benefits, they may result in 
strategic risks. However, EBL has consistently made well-considered decisions regarding the expansion of its manufactured capital that has 
allowed us to reap the associated benefits. A brief description of these risks can be found at page 184.

Investment in human 
capital has a short run 
outflow from financial 
capital. But effective 
investment always brings 
in positive inflow in all 
other capitals. 
So, selecting & training 
right group of employees 
is crucial for the overall 
benefit of the bank. EBL

Human capital is at the center of our organizational strategy for growth. It is defined as the capacity 
of individuals working in the Bank and their awareness about governance, ethical matters & risk 
management practices.
The core philosophy of eblHR is “People First,” that reflects our commitment to our employees 
and our dedication to maintaining a strong presence in the industry through the adoption of best 
banking practices and sound corporate governance. 
In 2024, we recruited 1,353 employees, including 35 individuals through our Future Leader 
Program—a distinctive initiative designed to recruit and talents to shape the future leadership at 
EBL. Our commitment to diversity & equal opportunity ensures that every employee is treated fairly.

Our e-learning exams are held twice a year and e-certification on ICT security, AML and etiquettes 
and professionalism once a year, ensuring all employees are updated on key banking knowledge. 
In 2024, there were 25,709 participants in these exams which reflects our effort to increase the 
value of our employee. 
To promote employee motivation and well-being, we have implemented a range of employee 
engagement initiatives, including sports activities, music events, and wellness sessions. Also, 
we conducted a comprehensive market survey to assess the competitiveness of our financial 
offerings, which led to a revision of our salary structure in 2024.

• Through recruiting right people, we will ensure a sustainable workforce that can be developed into future leadership roles.Way forwardHuman capital is a vital asset for any business organization, and for a bank, maintaining ethical and responsible human resources is essential. 
Failure to do so can lead to risks such as fraud, money laundering, and data breaches, which, if recurring, can cause significant reputational 
damage. To ensure sustainability and retain the trust of stakeholders, it is crucial for a bank to effectively mitigate these risks.
EBL is widely recognized for its strong governance and risk management practices. By adopting a zero-tolerance stance toward non-

Intellectual capital
Creative approach to work, brand value, innovative product & services for the customers, in-
built team expertise and customer satisfaction -- all these intangible assets are referred to as 
Intellectual capital.
Intellectual capital serves as a key, yet often intangible, driver for the Bank, providing a competitive 
edge in the industry and contributing to long-term sustainability. While intellectual capital is 
challenging to quantify, its influence can be observed across all areas of the organization. 
To maintain a strong competitive position and realize the benefits of this intellectual capital, 
EBL is focused on streamlining processes, upholding robust corporate governance, and fostering 
technological innovation.
Product & service innovation
Bank requires to offer innovative as well as secured banking products and services to meet 
customers’ needs and changing demands. In 2024, to improve security and include more 
banking services available at fingertips of customers, we revamped our Skybanking app. We also 
introduced Islamic Banking product and services to cater to the need of customers.
Strong corporate governance
A bank’s success hinges on strong corporate governance, which is crucial for stability in the long 
run. Good governance is built on ethical practices, commitment to values, and adherence to laws 
and regulations. The “tone at the top” significantly influences the bank’s growth. Hence, our Board 
views compliance not as a cost, but as a competitive advantage.
EBL Nest
A unique capacity building center of EBL, EBL Nest, facilitates idea generation across various 
departments of EBL through multiple brainstorming sessions. This initiative contributes to 
enhancing EBL’s presence in the industry. In 2024, a total of 45 Nest sessions were held where  a 
range of innovative ideas were generated for improving the Bank’s operations and performance.

Social & relationship capital
Social & relationship capital is an intangible capital which consists of the relationships, values 
& interests commonly shared with stakeholders of the Bank. For ensuring collective well-being 
of customer, regulator, local community as well as of the Bank, investing in social & relationship 
capital is essential. The social cohesion established by building relationship & networks with the 
stakeholders helps an organization to rely on them that has multiple benefits in pursuing long 
term growth.
Ensuring customer delight
EBL values its customers profoundly and we put all-out efforts to ensure customer delight by 
simplifying process, digitalizing services and analyzing customer feedbacks. As customer deposit 
consists of 78.92% of our financial capital, it emphasizes the importance of upholding customer 
trust. Through maintaining good corporate governance and compliance culture, we have been 
able to provide the customers comfort to keep their hard-earned money with us. Details are

laws and instructions. In 2024, no compliance issues were raised by regulators. As a responsible 
corporate entity, EBL pays corporate taxes on time, often ahead of schedule. We also deposit excise 
duty, withholding tax, VAT, and other deductions from customers, employees, and vendors to the 
government.

Impact on other 
capitals
Investing in preserving 
natural capital has a 
long-term benefit for 
the organization that 
penetrates through 
financial, intellectual, 
human and social and 
relationship capital. 
On the other hand, 
manufactured and natural 
capital are inversely 
related, so it is crucial 
to invest carefully in 
manufactured capital. SDG relevanceNatural capital
Natural capital is defined as the renewable & non-renewable resources like energy, water, air that 
are used by the organization for its value creation process.
EBL has always been advocating for sustainable growth that surpasses the profitability of the 
organization and extends to the societal and environmental well-being. 
In-house green initiatives
EBL puts efforts on optimizing resource use and reducing acquisition costs. We have implemented 
initiatives to ensure sustainable resource use with minimal waste, such as declaring our premises 
plastic-free since 2019 and replacing plastic items with eco-friendly alternatives. By installing 
auto sensor lights at our head office, water treatment plant and soil treatment facility, we optimize 
fuel and water consumption and minimize waste. These efforts aim to create a lasting, positive 
environmental impact.
Sustainable financing
In line with its commitment to corporate social responsibility, EBL has adopted green banking to 
mitigate its environmental impact. Acknowledging its role in greenhouse gas emissions, EBL has 
provided funding to the projects that focuses on energy and resource efficiency.

operations and financed portfolio. As a part of this initiative, we have collaborated with JIM 
Foundation and Ernst & Young Advisory Services Bangladesh Limited to measure the GHG 
emission. Also, to mitigate climate risk, we are setting targets to reduce GHG emission. The detail 
of these metrics and targets can be found at page 268.

Challenges faced in 2024
Initiatives taken by EBL in 2024
• The major challenge we are facing now is to implement the 
IFRS S1 and S2 in our bank within 2027.
• To measure the GHG emission from our internal operations 
is ongoing and ensuring data are available within due time.
• We are already working with central bank and some peers 
to understand the scope of IFRS S1 and S2 and its smooth 
implementation within timeframe.
• We have escalated to the respective departments to work 
on data management so that we can ensure correct GHG 
emission is measured.
• EBL will continue to encourage the green initiatives and go beyond our internal operations through financing our clients.
• To minimize GHG emissions, the first step is measurement. We are currently partnering with organizations that will assist us in tracking 
these emissions. Based on the measurements, we will establish targets and implement strategies to reduce emissions.Way forwardAssociated risks & risk management practice
Due to mismanagement of natural capital, environmental risk arises. Additionally, financing projects or business entities that pose significant 
threats to the environment can lead to reputational risks, as it may portray the bank as unethical and irresponsible in the eyes of stakeholders. 
To reduce such risks, EBL has Sustainable banking/ Environmental & Social Risk Management (ESRM) Policy in place and a dedicated team 
to monitor overall financing. 
As climate change impacts worsen, we are entering an era where climate risks—physical and transition—demand urgent attention. In line 
with IFRS S2 implementation, these risks must be incorporated into our risk management framework. Effectively managing and adapting to 
climate risks will benefit both the organization and the country. The detail can be found at page 265.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024235
INTEGRATED REPORTING
A A business model offers a concise overview of how an organization 
creates value by transforming inputs into outputs through various 
activities. In essence, it represents a company’s fundamental 
strategy for achieving profitable operations. For banks, ensuring 
business profitability involves generating a positive spread between 
the returns on loans and investments and the costs associated with 
deposits and borrowings, alongside corresponding non-funded 
earnings. EBL has consistently maintained a loan portfolio that 
comprises of approximately 75% corporate loans and 20% SME and 
retail loans, a spread of over 5% in december 2024 as well as has 
one of the lowest cost-to-income ratios in the industry.
The sustainability of EBL’s business model is deeply rooted in its 
strong commitment to good governance practices and a robust 
culture of compliance. Our effective asset-liability management, 
diligent credit underwriting, proactive management of stressed 
assets, and cost-efficient centralized operations all contribute to our 
success. Furthermore, we emphasize the development of innovative products 
and services, uphold people-centric HR values, and prioritize 
sustainable financing. The pragmatic leadership provided by our 
senior management and Board of Directors has further strengthened 
our position as one of the most effective and successful business 
models in the industry
Narrative flow of business model of EBL
Our business model outlines how we transform capital inputs 
into products and services for the financial market through 
various banking activities carried out across different business 
segments. This framework is strategically designed to fulfill the 
bank’s objectives which create value for stakeholders over time. 
In executing this model, we take into account the external factors, 
associated risks and opportunities and our internal strengths. The 
entire model is built upon the bank’s core foundation and supported 
by a strong governance framework that ensures the sustainability 
of the model and alignment with the industry best practices.Business Model  
Key Elements of a Business Model
Input
These are the essential resources used to create value and 
are crucial to the organization. Inputs are directly or indirectly 
linked to the six capitals outlined in an integrated report. We 
have identified multiple key inputs under each capital that 
contribute value to our stakeholders.Outcomes
These refer to the internal and external impacts—both positive 
and negative—that represent the final value created by the 
organization.
Business Activities
These are the primary activities that convert inputs into 
outputs. EBL continuously seeks opportunities for process 
reengineering and improvement to maintain a strong position 
amidst external changes.Stakeholders
The value created for stakeholders is crucial to the business 
model. Through various stakeholder assessment and 
engagements, EBL has identified six key stakeholders: 
shareholders/investors, customers, regulators, employees, 
society, and business partners.
Outputs
These encompass the key products and services offered by 
the business model. As a leading bank, EBL provides a range 
of products and services tailored to various customer groups.External Factors
Identifying key external factors that can influence value 
creation is also important. These factors include the political 
environment, economic shifts, climate change, regulatory 
changes, and technological disruptions.SocietySocietyOrganizationOrganization Business modelOpportunities

Connectivity to key information
The business model of EBL encompasses all the essential elements 
that reflect the strategies established by the management in short, 
medium and long term along with resource allocation. It illustrates 
how key inputs and business activities navigate risks and seize opportunities to create value for stakeholders. Each element of the 
inputs, aligned with the six capitals and their effective utilization, 
contributes to achieving KPIs and driving financial stability. And 
more importantly, the business model is firmly anchored in a robust 
governance framework that ensures its long-term sustainability.

Human Resource Accounting (HRA)
The purpose of human resource accounting is to recognize the value of human resources of an organization. It is assessed by evaluating 
recruitment, training, development costs, employee compensation, and the economic value generated by the employees. Effective 
management of tangible and financial assets are significantly influenced by the quality, skills, and attitude of an organization’s people. 
The sustainable growth of EBL is the reflection of the competitive advantage provided by our skilled workforce which has consistently helped 
us to navigate through the challenging financial landscape. By upholding the motto, “People First,” we invest in our employees throughout the 
entire recruitment-to-retention process that has resulted in positive outcomes across financial, intellectual, social and relationship capital. 
Objectives of HRA
• Monitor human resources and their productivity efficiently.
• Facilitate human resource planning.
• Provide quantitative information on human resources for better policy implementation.
Importance of HRA at EBL
As a people-centric organization, we recognize the significant value that employee well-being brings to our institution. Consequently, the 
measurement of Human Resource Accounting (HRA) at EBL plays a vital role and its impact can be summarized as follows:
• It enables effective monitoring of human resources in utilizing their expertise and full potential.
• It assists management in ensuring the sustainability of human capital through strategic planning and ongoing evaluation.
• It provides valuable insights into investments in human resources and return on investment that help to design employee training and 
development programs.
• It serves as a tool for implementing and assessing the impact of policies on human capital.
• It helps to set strategies for recruitment and retention efforts that ultimately, contributes to the consistent success of the Bank.
To enhance employee morale and job satisfaction, we provide a competitive financial benefits package and actively promote work-life 
balance. Furthermore, EBL prioritizes the health and safety of its employees by implementing various initiatives, including wellness 
programs, employee engagement activities, recognition programs, and appreciation efforts. We are committed to maintaining an inclusive 
culture and upholding strong corporate governance values through the effective implementation of our structured HR policies, which directly 
contribute to our overall productivity.PARTICULARS 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020

SWOT Analysis: A Strategic Lens  
SWOT analysis is more than an assessment; it is a strategic lens - a way to leverage strengths, address vulnerabilities, and seize opportunities 
in a changing financial landscape. It’s about seeing beyond the obvious; questioning assumptions, and positioning EBL for sustainable 
growth in an increasingly complex world.

PESTEL Analysis
P
SEPolitical
Between disruption and design, a new political logic is taking shape.
 Overall Perspective 
The year 2024 marked a significant turning point in Bangladesh’s political trajectory. Widespread civil movements, driven by a collective demand for accountability 
and institutional reform, led to the fall of a regime in August 2024. Subsequently, an interim government was formed, initiating a broad reform agenda focused on 
strengthening electoral processes, judicial independence, and administrative transparency.
Yet, transitions rarely begin with certainty. While the promise of reforms created space for optimism, it also surfaced deeper complexities. Combined with regional tensions 
and ongoing instability along the southeastern border, these factors continue to influence public sentiment and investor outlook. As 2025 begins, the question is no longer 
whether change will happen - but whether it can evolve into something sustained, inclusive, and steady enough to restore confidence at home and abroad.
 Our Perspective 
At EBL, we believe resilience is not the absence of turbulence - but the clear determination to navigate through it. The current political environment calls for just that.
In 2024, we reinforced governance structures, deepened our compliance culture, and aligned strategic priorities with evolving policy signals—not only as a response to 
uncertainty, but as a foundation for long-term positioning. In moments of transition, credibility is not earned through visibility, but through consistency, foresight, 
and trust. As Bangladesh moves toward a reform-oriented future, we remain steadfast in our role enabling growth, safeguarding stability, and staying prepared 
for what comes next.
Social
Society isn’t just changing - it’s signaling.
 Overall Perspective 
Bangladesh’s social fabric shifted quietly yet decisively in 2024. What began as student-led protests over recruitment quotas evolved into a broader civil 
awakening - driven by a generational demand for fairness, representation, and institutional accountability.
The labor force contracted during the year, declining from 61.10 million to 59.20 million in Q3 2024, while youth unemployment remained high at 1.94 million 
as per BBS. Urban female youth unemployment stood at 13.30%. Amid sustained inflation, peaking at 11.38% in November, pressure on low and middle-income 
households intensified. Mobile financial service (MFS) transactions rose by 28.42% year-on-year, particularly among rural and informal segments, signaling a 
shift from mere access to a demand for clarity, speed, and trust.
 Our Perspective 
In 2024, EBL launched its Islamic Banking operation, aligning with the rising societal preference for ethical, Shariah-compliant financial services. We expanded our 
agent banking footprint to 118 outlets, broadening access across underserved communities. Our CMSME loan portfolio grew to BDT 41,123 million, underscoring our 
commitment to grassroots entrepreneurship.
We welcomed 1,353 new hires, 15% of whom were women, and reinforced workplace trust through ethical recruitment, wellness initiatives, and responsive grievance 
redressal.
The upgraded EBL Skybanking app further embedded simplicity, speed, and transparency into daily banking. Our CSR approach remained focused and structured: 30% 
of funds supported education, another 30% healthcare, and 20% climate resilience. Through our partnership with Moner Bondhu, we supported the mental health of over 
5,000 RMG workers, while continuing to invest in literacy, youth development, and inclusive well-being.Economic
2024 didn’t break the economy - it revealed what must be rebuilt.
 Overall Perspective 
In the second half of 2024, Bangladesh’s economic narrative shifted - from managing symptoms to confronting structural constraints. 
A wave of macroeconomic reforms followed institutional recalibrations, but progress remained uneven. Confidence, both domestic 
and foreign, became increasingly dependent on coherence, delivery, and credibility.
GDP growth moderated. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) reported FY 2024 growth at 4.22%, primarily due to an export 
slowdown and policy uncertainty amid domestic and global headwinds. Despite the central bank raising the policy rate to 10%, 
point-to-point inflation peaked at 11.38% in November, with food inflation hitting 13.8%, before easing to 10.89% in December.
On the external front, pressures began to stabilize. Foreign exchange reserves (BPM6) rebounded to USD 21.42 billion by December 
2024, supported by import controls and steady remittance inflows.
The banking sector came under increased scrutiny. According to BB, the NPL ratio rose to 20.20% as of December 2024 - the highest 
on record. Despite reported excess liquidity of BDT 2.15 trillion, credit appetite remained subdued, with private sector credit growth 
slowing to 7.28%. These trends underscore persistent challenges in asset quality, governance, and lending discipline..
 Our Perspective 
In 2024, EBL recorded loan growth of 16.23% and deposit growth of 25.02%, while maintaining strong asset quality - gross NPL stood at 
3.34%, well below the industry average. Liquidity was prudently managed, with solid buffers maintained across LCR, NSFR, and MCO, despite 
systemic pressures. Capital strength remained a defining pillar, with Tier-1 capital rising to BDT 40,343 million and CRAR reaching 15.11%, 
ensuring ample regulatory headroom.
EBL’s investment income, in 2024, grew by 32.40%. Operational efficiency also improved: the cost-to-income ratio declined to 40.14% (from 44.22%), 
and ROE rose to 18.63% (from 16.85%). EBL also retained its AAA credit rating with a stable outlook, reaffirming institutional credibility.

T
ETechnology
Digital isn’t an upgrade - it’s the baseline for trust, convenience, and future growth.
 Overall Perspective 
With over 130 million internet users, according to BTRC, and smartphone penetration estimated around 50% as per the GSMA report, digital engagement in Bangladesh 
has become mainstream. The widespread growth of mobile financial services—fueled by mobile accessibility, declining data costs, and inclusive policies—continues to 
reshape how people transact and save.
The financial sector continues to lead this shift. According to Statista, a Germany-based global market intelligence firm, Bangladesh’s digital payments market is projected 
to reach USD 48.40 billion by 2025, growing at over 32% annually, with all transactions occurring within the domestic ecosystem.
Yet challenges persist. Around 70% of banks still rely on legacy core banking systems, limiting agility and cybersecurity readiness. RegTech—short for Regulatory 
Technology—grew by 33.90% in 2024, reaching USD 151 million. It leverages AI and automation to help banks manage compliance, monitor risk, and detect fraud in real 
time.
 Our Perspective 
In 2024, EBL re-launched its fully in-house developed Skybanking app, now with 150+ features, enhancing speed, personalization, and security. We also integrated a 
Smart IVR system and rolled out a Shariah-compliant Islamic Core Banking System across 20 branches, merging innovation with inclusion.
Operational resilience was reinforced through dual disaster recovery sites, GSM-based connectivity across outlets, and real-time RTGS integration with the 
central bank. We retained PCI DSS and ISO 27001 certifications, enhanced dark web monitoring, and delivered cybersecurity awareness training to over 
2,600 employees.
Environment
Sustainability is no longer a strategy – it is stability.
 Overall Perspective 
 In 2024, Bangladesh’s climate vulnerabilities deepened. The country faced two major cyclones - Remal in May and Dana in October 
- and endured record-breaking heatwaves, including a 58-year high of 40.6°C in Dhaka, reinforcing the economic urgency of climate 
adaptation.
In response, Bangladesh Bank accelerated sector-wide reforms to integrate sustainability into financial governance. A key milestone 
was the phased adoption of IFRS S1 and S2, aligned with ISSB and TCFD frameworks, mandating climate-related disclosures across 
governance, strategy, and risk metrics.
At the same time, ESRM guidelines were strengthened, requiring ESG due diligence in all lending decisions. Banks were also 
directed to allocate 10% of their CSR budgets to a Climate Risk Fund. By Q3 2024, green finance accounted for 16.6% of total term 
loan disbursements, and sustainable finance reached 45.2% of total lending, according to Bangladesh Bank’s Quarterly Review.
 Our Perspective 
In 2024, EBL advanced its environmental agenda with measurable impact. We became the first Bangladeshi bank to disclose portfolio-level 
GHG emissions using the JIM model under PCAF standards. Green and sustainable finance disbursements reached BDT 216.5 billion - green 
finance comprised 35.24% and sustainable finance 89.48% of term loans, exceeding regulatory thresholds. We partnered with ADB, IFC, and 
ERM Vietnam to enhance ESG due diligence.
Operationally, we embraced paperless processes and green logistics with DHL to reduce our carbon footprint. Our financing supported 204 energy-
efficient projects, 23 LEED-certified clients, and climate-resilient infrastructure. In recognition, we received the Sustainability Rating Recognition 
2023 from Bangladesh Bank in 2024 and were awarded “Best Climate Focus Bank” at the 24th National Conference and Green Expo.
Legal
The future of finance belongs to those who govern it well.
 Overall Perspective 
In 2024, rising concerns over asset quality, governance gaps, and financial stability prompted regulatory recalibration. The government announced a Bank 
Reform Commission, while Bangladesh Bank formed a task force to audit systemic vulnerabilities and recommend structural reforms.
A key milestone was the enactment of the Offshore Banking Act 2024, introducing a formal regulatory framework for cross-border transactions under central 
bank oversight. Amendments to the Bank Company Act further strengthened board governance and institutional compliance.
Banks began the phased adoption of IFRS 9, reinforcing risk-based provisioning. Simultaneously, the rollout of IFRS S1 and S2 ushered in climate and 
sustainability disclosures - marking a convergence of financial, legal, and ESG standards. Enforcement intensified across AML/CFT protocols and ICT risk 
supervision, establishing compliance as a foundation of institutional credibility.
 Our Perspective 
In line with regulatory directives, EBL established a centralized Legal Affairs Division, integrating litigation, documentation, and recovery under one platform. A Special 
Write-off Recovery Unit was also formed to target legacy exposures.
Throughout the year, 9,934 suits were filed, 1,346 judgments secured, and 1,021 arrest warrants executed. 282 writs and appeals remained under Supreme Court review, 
monitored by 28 in-house legal officers.
Real-time dashboards, cause list tracking, and legal vetting enhanced responsiveness, while coordination with panel lawyers and law enforcement ensured execution. 
EBL also progressed on IFRS 9, S1, and S2 readiness.
In recognition of its governance and compliance standards, EBL earned its sixth ICSB Gold Award in 2023, reaffirming that institutional trust rests as much on legal 
clarity and compliance as on financial strength.L

252EBL’s Competitive Landscape and Market 
Positioning
To evaluate the competitive landscape of the banking industry and support informed decision-making for our stakeholders, we have 
applied Porter’s Five Forces framework. This model provides insights into competitive positioning and industry dynamics by analyzing 
five key factors:
Factors:
• Banks operate under a strict regulatory framework complying with certain 
prudential ratios and standards including capital adequacy, anti-money 
laundering (AML) and other governing policies which collectively create 
significant barriers to entry.
• The capital requirements under the Bank Company Act, 1991 (amended 
up to 2023) make it challenging for new entrants to raise and maintain the 
necessary funds.
• Despite regulatory scrutiny, the issuance of new banking licenses ultimately 
depends on government discretion.
• Established banks benefit from strong brand recognition and customer 
trust, making it difficult for new entrants to gain market share.
• However, Mobile Financial Service (MFS) providers pose a growing threat as 
they offer services that compete with traditional banks.
Factors:
In banking, the main “suppliers” are those who provide capital, funding, and 
essential services for operations.
• Customers who deposit money in EBL are the key suppliers, as 78.92% of our 
funding comes from customer deposits. However, individual depositors have 
limited bargaining power, unlike large corporate clients and high net-worth 
individuals. 
• Borrowing from other financial institutions play a vital role in ensuring 
smooth cash flow. It depends on relationship with financial institutions, 
interest rate negotiations as well as EBL’s financial stability. 
• Suppliers of goods and services generally have limited bargaining power, 
except for IT service providers – such as software, cybersecurity, and 
infrastructure firms, who play a critical role in modern banking operations.
Factors:
In banking, the primary “buyers/customers” refer to individuals and businesses 
that access financial services, including loan and advances, non-funded 
facilities such as guarantees and letters of credit and so on. Unlike traditional 
industries where buyers purchase physical goods, banking customers engage 
in long-term financial relationships, making their bargaining power a key 
factor in industry competitiveness.
• Bangladesh’s financial sector is highly competitive relative to its size of 
economy, with 62 scheduled banks and 35 Financial Institutions (FIs) 
offering diverse financial products and services. As a result, customers have 
the freedom to choose from multiple institutions at no switching cost, giving 
them high bargaining power to demand better products and services.
• Large corporate customers wield significant bargaining power, as they can 
negotiate favorable terms, competitive rates, and customized services. They 
may also switch banks if a competitor offers a more attractive proposition.Our response:
• We diligently adhere to government policies and 
regulations, ensuring operational resilience and 
long-term sustainability. Our strong governance and 
compliance culture foster transparency in banking 
operations, providing us with a competitive edge.
• By offering new product propositions, advancing in digital 
banking, enhancing customer service, and maintaining 
financial stability, we have built a trusted brand in the 
banking sector. This reinforces customer confidence, 
ensuring continued banking relationships even during 
industry uncertainties or the entry of new competitors.
Our response:
• By diversifying our deposit portfolio with tailored 
offerings for corporate, retail, and SME clients, EBL 
ensures steady deposit growth throughout the year. 
Additionally, we continuously nurture Priority Banking, 
offering premium support to the high-value customers 
who have demonstrated long term loyalty.
• EBL has maintained steady financial growth and strong 
regulatory compliance over the years, enabling easy 
access to borrowing from banks and Financial Institutions 
(FIs). This has strengthened our relationships, providing a 
competitive advantage in negotiating better terms.
Our response:
• EBL’s customer-centric approach prioritizes seamless 
services delivery through relationship management and 
digitalization of routine banking tasks. We empower 
customers to make informed financial decisions, fostering 
long-term relationships.
• With a legacy spanning over three decades, EBL has 
consistently maintained strong corporate governance, 
ensuring stability even during financial crises. By 
leveraging our internal strength, we instill customers 
trust, encouraging them to maintain a long-term banking 
relationship with EBL.Threat of new entrants

EBL’s Position within the Value Chain
EBL has maintained its strong governance and brand image for over 3 decades and has grown into one of the most stable banks in the 
banking industry. Our market position in terms of major financial volume is given below:  Factors:
• The banking industry is highly competitive, with numerous financial 
institutions offering similar products and services at comparable prices. 
Even minor differentiations in product offerings or interest rates can have a 
significant impact on market dynamics.
• While banks compete on interest rates for deposits and loans, as well as 
fees for banking services, regulatory constraints limit the extent of price 
competition. As a result, banks focus on customer service, technology, and 
operational efficiency to gain a competitive edge. 
• Digital transformation has emerged as a key battleground, with institutions 
leveraging technology to enhance customer experience and streamline 
operations.
Factors:
• Banks remain the primary source of capital in our economy, offering similar 
financial products across the industry. Since there is no absolute substitute 
for credit and deposit products, the threat from direct substitutes remains 
low.
• However, Mobile financial service (MFS) providers pose a potential future 
threat, offering instant financial services. While currently limited to basic 
transactions, they could expand into broader banking services over time.
• During high-interest rate periods, customers may opt for alternative 
investment options such as sanchaypatra, treasury bill and bonds instead of 
keeping deposits in banks. Our response:
• To stay ahead of the competition, EBL continually 
strategizes its internal capabilities, fostering strong 
governance and operational resilience – a strategy that 
has proven invaluable during financial crises.
• With digital solutions like the Skybanking app, EBL Self-
Service Hub, EBLConnect, SmartIVR, and fully online 
branch banking, EBL delivers seamless and convenient 
banking experiences. We remain committed to continue 
digital innovation, ensuring customer satisfaction and a 
sustained competitive advantage.
Our response:
• EBL continuously innovates to provide tailored financial 
solutions that align with customer needs and convenience. 
By delivering a seamless banking experience through 
innovative services, we ensure customer loyalty and 
differentiation in the industry.
• Through expanding our digital footprints, we aim to 
reach unbanked segments and the younger generation, 
enhancing financial accessibility while catering to 
diverse customer needs.The intensity of competitive rivalry

254Segment Analysis
Eastern Bank PLC. (EBL) structures its operations through two principal business segments - Domestic Banking Operations and Offshore 
Banking Operations—designed to meet the diverse needs of its customers while ensuring operational efficiency and regulatory compliance. 
These segments are supported by three core business units: Corporate Banking, Retail & SME Banking, and Treasury. While Corporate and 
Retail & SME Banking focus on lending, trade finance, and fund mobilization, Treasury manages liquidity, maintain CRR/SLR in line with 
regulatory requirements, and facilitate investment and foreign exchange operations.
• Domestic Banking Operations (DBO), comprising both conventional and Islamic banking window, form the backbone of EBL’s commercial 
banking activities. With the introduction of Islamic Banking in 2024, the Bank has further diversified its product suite to cater to the 
evolving needs of a broader client base. This segment integrates Retail, SME, Corporate banking to deliver a full spectrum of lending and 
deposit services, with Treasury playing a pivotal role in liquidity management, reserve maintenance, and market transactions.
• Offshore Banking Operations (OBO), provide a comprehensive range of services in freely convertible foreign currencies, serving eligible

256Capital Adequacy Statement
All scheduled banks in Bangladesh are mandated to calculate their Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) in accordance with the 
‘Revised Guidelines on Risk-Based Capital Adequacy (RBCA)’ issued by the Bangladesh Bank in December 2014 and subsequent circulars. 
According to these guidelines, banks are required to maintain a minimum CRAR of 12.50% (which includes a Capital Conservation Buffer of 
2.50%) of their overall Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) to ensure financial stability and to instill confidence among the key stakeholders.

260Foreword
Transitioning towards sustainable banking necessitates a 
fundamental shift in mindset—one that prioritizes societal and 
environmental well-being alongside financial goals. In the face of 
escalating climate crises, banks must swiftly adopt sustainability 
as its core principle as they actively participate in an economic 
environment where their financial decisions have influence 
on present and future of the people, planet and profit of the 
organization. Heightened expectations from customers, regulators, 
investors, employees, and the public demand greater transparency 
and accountability compelling banks to proactively embrace 
sustainable practices.
EBL’s enduring commitment to excellence has supported its steady 
and sustainable growth over three decades. Recognizing our duty 
to clients, investors, and communities, we prioritize trust-building 
as a foundation to our success. To us, sustainability is not a mere 
responsibility; it represents an opportunity to make meaningful 
changes and foster community betterment. We firmly believe in 
the imperative of a social mission for every business; as neglecting 
social and environmental factors undermines long-term economic 
success. At EBL, we prioritize consumer satisfaction, digital 
advancement, product innovation, staff engagement, and financial 
performance, leveraging today’s technology to amplify our impact 
on people, planet and profit in a sustainable way.
In this report, EBL is disclosing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission 
at portfolio level through Carbon Accounting calculation in 
partnership with Joint Impact Model (JIM) Foundation and DEG (German Development Financial Institution). JIM enables the 
quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, indirect jobs, and 
the value added by EBL’s financing. This JIM Carbon Accounting 
model is based on standards set by PCAF (Partnership for Carbon 
Accounting Financials). This underscores our commitment to 
addressing climate challenges and aligning with the SDGs. This 
is our continuation of pilot project with JIM foundation which we 
took in 2022. Now EBL is able to calculate amount of CO2 and Non-
CO2 emission from the business loans that we are financing and 
also bringing comparability, accountability, and transparency to the 
financial sector of Bangladesh by measuring key impact indicators.
As a pioneer in the nation’s financial landscape, EBL leads by 
example, advocating best practices and driving industry standards. 
For us, sustainability entails not just ethical operations but also 
makes positive contributions to our community and stakeholders. 
Over three decades, EBL has played a pivotal role in shaping 
Bangladesh’s financial ecosystem, deeply intertwined with the 
country’s growth narrative.
In 2024, EBL made significant strides towards advancing the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our efforts included 
promoting financial inclusion through agent and Sub-Branch 
outlets, hosting webinars on education and gender equality, and 
developing low-cost products for women entrepreneurs. Notably, 
we disbursed substantial funds towards green financing and 
sustainable projects, reflecting our commitment to environmental 
conservation and social progress. Key achievements of 2024 are:

EBL remains dedicated to financing eco-friendly projects and 
fostering energy efficiency. We have implemented an Environment 
and Social Risk Management System to assess project risks 
and promote cleaner energy financing in alignment with our 
climate change mitigation efforts. Collaborating with multilateral 
organizations like IFC, DEG, ADB, and others, EBL upholds

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
EBL’s Sustainability Report 2024
This report presents a comprehensive overview of Eastern Bank PLC’s 
progress on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters 
for the financial year 2024. In December 2023, Bangladesh Bank 
introduced the IFRS S1 (Sustainability-related Financial Disclosures) 
and IFRS S2 (Climate-related Financial Disclosures), mandating 
disclosure of sustainability and climate-related risks in line with 
global best practices. In response, EBL successfully submitted its IFRS 
S1 & S2 reports for H1 and H2 of 2024, underscoring its commitment 
to transparency and responsible banking. 
EBL continues to enhance its reporting framework by integrating climate 
risk and broader ESG considerations to meet regulatory and stakeholder 
expectations. This report reflects compliance with the new standards 
and marks a significant milestone in our sustainability journey.
In addition to IFRS-aligned disclosures, EBL follows GRI Sustainability 
Reporting Standards to maintain transparency on how its operations 
and decisions impact society and the environment.
As defined in the Brundtland Report (Our Common Future, 
1987), sustainable development means meeting present needs 
without compromising future generations. Financial institutions 
influence the economy, environment, and people - positively or 
negatively - through their decisions and relationships. GRI-based reporting helps us communicate our contributions to sustainable 
development, both direct and indirect. 
EBL’s ESG framework and strategic 
focus 2024
In 2024, EBL reaffirmed its commitment to sustainability 
by further strengthening its Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) framework. ESG principles have 
been integrated across the Bank’s business strategy, 
financial operations, and risk management practices to 
ensure long-term value creation for stakeholders and 
to contribute meaningfully to Bangladesh’s sustainable 
development.
These efforts align with the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), with a strategic focus on 
advancing a green economy. A green economy is 
defined by low carbon emissions, efficient resource use, 
and inclusive growth. It drives employment and income 
through public and private investments in activities, 
infrastructure, and technologies that reduce emissions 
and pollution, enhance energy and resource efficiency, 
and safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem health.Sustainable banking/

Dedicated Environmental & 
Social Risk teamEBL’s approach towards sustainabilityImportant Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements in Eastern Bank PLC’s (EBL) 2024 Annual Report are forward-looking and aligned with IFRS S1 and S2 standards. These 
statements reflect EBL’s goals, strategies, and commitments related to sustainability, ESG priorities, climate risk management, and the transition 
to a low-carbon economy. They are based on current assumptions and expectations, and often include terms like “expect,” “plan,” and “intend.”
However, such statements are subject to various uncertainties—such as regulatory shifts, economic conditions, technological changes, and external 
risks (e.g., climate events or geopolitical factors). As such, actual outcomes may differ materially. 
EBL advises stakeholders not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, as various risk factors—such as credit risk, market risk, 
liquidity risk, regulatory compliance risk, and climate-related financial risks—may impact actual outcomes. These risks are discussed in greater 
detail in the Risk Management section of EBL’s Annual Report 2024.

262IFRS S1 (Sustainability-related financial 
Disclosures) and IFRS S2 (Climate-related 
financial disclosures)
IFRS S1 and S2 are global standards introduced by the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation to improve 
the transparency, consistency, and reliability of sustainability 
and climate-related disclosures by financial institutions. These 
standards aim to provide investors and stakeholders with clear, 
comparable non-financial information on the financial impact of 
ESG and climate-related risks.
Built on a four-pillar structure, the standards ensure comprehensive 
coverage of key Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
factors. In Bangladesh, the central bank has outlined a three-
year implementation roadmap for banks to meet full disclosure 
requirements.
At EBL, we have long been a frontrunner in sustainability and are 
committed to being among the pioneer banks in the country to 
publish a comprehensive report under IFRS S1 and S2. In 2024, we 
have disclosed the majority of required elements, with climate risk 
assessments (physical and transition risks) currently in progress. 
These will be included in future disclosures. This proactive stance underscores our leadership in sustainable finance and our ongoing 
commitment to transparency.
Pillar 1: Governance
EBL remains at the forefront of Bangladesh’s banking sector 
in adopting international best practices for corporate social 
responsibility and governance. A key pillar of our strategic agenda is 
to lead in sustainable finance through strong institutional oversight.
Role of Board of Directors
The governance mechanism established by the Board of Directors 
(BoD) concerning sustainability are as follows:
• Except for matters reserved for the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM), the Board retains exclusive authority to approve all 
general policies and strategies, including those related to 
sustainability.• The BoD also oversees the Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) Policy, ensuring alignment with the Bank’s long-term 
value creation goals.
Role of Sustainable Finance Committee (SFC)
The Sustainable Finance Committee, chaired by a Deputy Managing 
Director (DMD), comprises heads of key divisions engaged in 
sustainability. The committee meets at least quarterly to formulate, 
review, and update all policies and guidelines related to sustainable 
finance. It also supervises and evaluates the activities of the 
Sustainable Finance Unit (SFU), ensuring alignment with regulatory 
expectations and strategic priorities.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Role of Sustainable Finance unit (SFU)
EBL’s Sustainable Finance Unit (SFU), chaired by the Head of 
Credit Risk Management, includes members from the Corporate 
Division, Credit Risk Management Division, and Risk Management 
Division etc. The SFU is responsible for designing, reviewing, and 
administering the Bank’s sustainable finance policies and ensuring 
alignment with regulatory guidelines and strategic goals.
Role of Credit Risk Management & Internal Control 
systems
The Credit Risk Management (CRM) team evaluates Environmental 
and Social (E&S) risks at the client level, along with any reputational 
risks tied to socially or environmentally sensitive transactions. Based 
on these assessments, CRM issues non-binding recommendations 
to the relevant approving authorities.
As the third line of defense, the Internal Audit team regularly 
assesses the implementation of EBL’s Environmental and Social 
Risk Management (ESRM) system, including adherence to green 
banking and sustainable operations guidelines. These controls are embedded in a governance framework shaped by EBL’s six core 
organizational values (see ‘Core Values’ section, page 15), reinforcing 
our commitment to responsible banking and sustainability.
Pillar 2: Strategy 
EBL acknowledges its significant role in combating climate 
change and has been committed to making a positive impact on 
its stakeholders for years. Guided by our three environmental 
principles, we focus on identifying and developing sustainable 
business opportunities while effectively managing and mitigating 
climate-related risks.
EBL is committed to fostering transparent and continuous dialogue 
with its stakeholders to effectively address market demands and 
improve the energy efficiency of both our operations and financial 
services. In alignment with this commitment, we have developed 
a comprehensive strategic framework over a five-year period, 
outlining our key priorities, essential tools and mechanisms, and 
a detailed action plan to achieve our Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) objectives.Organizational Structure for E & S Governance

266As we look ahead, EBL is now focusing on assessing and 
mitigating climate-related risks as integral components of our risk 
management framework. We recognize that climate risk presents 
potential threats that could lead to financial losses or adversely 
affect our activities in the short, medium, and long term. These 
risks could also heighten our exposure to strategic, reputational, 
and regulatory compliance challenges if our response is perceived 
as inadequate or non-compliant with our commitments.
Climate risk comprises two main categories: physical risks and 
transition risks. Physical risks involve the potential impact of 
increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, while transition risks arise from the shift toward a low-carbon economy, 
including changes in technology, policy, and regulations aimed at 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
To proactively address these risks, EBL has initiated pilot projects 
with various DFIs and Multi-Development Financial Institutions 
(MDFIs), striving to align with global best practices in climate 
risk assessment. We are committed to integrating climate 
considerations into our decision-making processes, enhancing our 
capabilities in analyzing climate risk, and offering ongoing climate 
risk management training to our employees, particularly those in 
client-facing roles.
Climate risk management at EBL
Integrating Climate Considerations into Risk Management Framework
Looking ahead: climate risk as a core focus 
• EBL is conducting a comprehensive GHG emissions 
assessment, covering operational emissions (Scope 1 & 2) and 
financed emissions (Scope 3).
• EBL is actively integrating climate risk into its risk management 
framework and strategic decision-making processes.
• Key challenges include financial exposure and reputational 
risks arising from climate-related factors.
• EBL will adopt proactive approach to identifying and mitigating 
climate risks across short, medium, and long-term horizons.Regulatory 
risk
Reputational 
riskFinancial 
risk
Strategic 
risk
Physical Risks: Extreme weather events such as 
floods, cyclones, heat waves etc. pose significant risks 
to assets, infrastructure, and economic stability. As 
these events become more frequent and intense due 
to climate change, banks face increasing exposure to 
credit, market, and operational risks, impacting both 
borrowers and overall financial resilience.Transition Risks: Transition risks refer to the financial 
and operational challenges banks face as economies 
shift toward low-carbon and sustainable practices. 
These risks arise from evolving climate policies, 
technological advancements, and regulatory changes, 
impacting borrowers' business models, asset valuations, 
and overall credit risk exposure. Effective management 
of transition risks is crucial for maintaining portfolio 
resilience and aligning with sustainability goals.Understanding climate risks

As per Bangladesh Bank’s Sustainable Finance Department guideline, EBL sets its annual disbursement target for Green finance and 
sustainable finance at the beginning of the calendar year on the basis of its immediate past year’s loan outstanding. But actual achievement 
at year-end is calculated based on disbursement made throughout the year.
New target requirement
From 2025 onwards, the targets have been revised: Green finance must now constitute at least 5%, while Sustainable finance must constitute 
at least 40%, of the outstanding portfolio (excluding staff loan, classified loan, credit card loan) based on December 31, 2024 which was 
previously 2% and 15% of respective financing target.

268GHG emissions from EBL’s operations
Current approach to GHG emissions measurement
EBL is committed to tracking and reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its internal operations. This includes Scope 1 (direct 
emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased electricity). EBL is currently calculating its Scope 1 & 2 emission in collaboration 
with Ernst & Young Advisory Services Bangladesh Ltd. (EY ASBL) and planning to publish carbon emission from EBLs operational activities 
within H1 of 2025. This GHG emission will provide the Bank a baseline where we can take strategic decisions to control and effectively minimize 
carbon emission.Resource utilization by the Bank 2024 2023

Scope 1
Scope 2Emissions (direct emissions) calculation
Scope 1 emissions cover direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by EBL, such as:
Emissions (indirect emissions from purchased electricity) calculation
Scope 2 emission covers indirect greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the purchase and consumption 
of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling from external sources, such as: 
Fuel consumption in generators & vehicles
Electricity usage data
Refrigerant emissions from air conditioning (AC) systems
Emission factor application
• Data is collected on diesel and petrol consumption in EBL’s 
fleet and backup power generators.
• Emissions are calculated using emission factors from 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines 
or national energy standards.
• Monthly electricity consumption (kWh) is gathered from utility 
bills.
• EBL tracks the quantity of refrigerants used in cooling systems 
across branches and offices.
• Emissions are estimated based on the type and leakage rates 
of refrigerants.
• The national grid emission factor (provided by the Sustainable 
and Renewable Energy Development Authority - SREDA or 
IPCC) is applied to estimate indirect CO₂ emissions.Internal Resource optimization
Our commitment towards achieving environmental sustainability, 
we have always gone beyond the target set by the central bank, 
reflected in our overall portfolio. 
Our primary target is to minimize resource utilization wastage as 
much as possible and as part of that goal we have taken several 
environmental initiatives (page 276). Due to inflation and increase 
in human and manufacturing capital, the resource utilization cost 
has increased slightly.Sustainable and green finance portfolio as on 31 December 2024

270The Joint Impact Model (JIM) empowers users with the ability 
to gauge financial flows across the economy and assess their 
consequential impacts in economic (value added), social 
(employment), and environmental (greenhouse gas emissions) 
dimensions. Leveraging input data such as revenue and power 
production derived from investment portfolios, JIM facilitates 
estimations that aid in understanding the multifaceted effects of 
economic activities.
To prevent warming beyond 1.5 degree Celsius (1.5C), the world 
needs to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The financial industry 
can facilitate the transition in line with the Paris Climate Agreement 
by shifting capital flows from high to low carbon activities. A key first

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
EBL’s activities in 2024 towards achieving sustainable development goals
Economic sustainability
EBL’s contribution to GDP
Through our collaboration with the JIM foundation, we have also calculated EBL’s value addition through financing activities. In 2024, EBL 
has contributed approx. BDT 273.79 billion in Bangladesh’s GDP.
Total value added: the sum of wages, taxes and savings, equivalent 
to gross domestic product, expressed in monetary value. 
• Wages (salaries): value of net wages paid to all full-time and 
part-time employees of the organization during the reporting 
period. 
• Taxes: all transfers to the government made by a client over 
the reporting period. 
• Savings (profit): value of the organization’s net earnings 
(profit).
Indirect Contribution through financing is calculated by using 
Joint Impact Model (JIM) toolkit. The main methodology used to 
estimate a company’s economic and environmental impact is 
input-output (I/O) modelling. This can be done using a statistical 
representation of an economy, referred to as a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). Details information can be found in this link: 
www.jointimpactmodel.org/methodology
Direct economic value generated for stakeholders
EBL is committed to generate values for the stakeholders in a 
sustainable manner, the outcome of which can be seen through 
the consistent growth in profit after tax and one of the lowest NPL 
across the industry. Details of the value generation for stakeholders 
can be found under “Value Added Statement” at page 77.
Financial inclusion
EBL is committed to empowering the small and medium-sized 
enterprises, farmers and women entrepreneurs. By providing 
access to credit, customized products and required training 
opportunities, EBL help them unlocking the potential to achieve 
their financial goals. (BDT in billion)

World Environment Day 2024: driving awareness and action
DHL eco-friendly shipping initiative: greener logistics for trade finance
Capacity building: training programs conducted by Bangladesh Bank and IFC officialsEBL celebrated “World Environment Day 2024”, reinforcing its 
commitment to sustainability. The event featured tree-planting 
activities, employee engagement programs, and awareness 
campaigns across branches. Employees participated in eco-friendly 
initiatives, emphasizing EBL’s role in promoting green finance and 
responsible banking. 
In addition, EBL launched an internal “Green Pledge Program”, 
encouraging employees to adopt eco-friendly habits such as 
minimizing paper use, reducing energy consumption, reducing 
waste and adopting sustainable commuting.
As part of its commitment to reducing Scope 3 emissions, EBL has 
partnered with DHL’s Go Green Plus initiative to adopt sustainable 
aviation fuel (SAF) for the transportation of trade-related documents. 
This collaboration is expected to reduce carbon emissions by at 
least 30%, making trade finance operations more climate-friendly.
With EBL handling more than USD 6 billion in trade finance 
annually, this initiative marks a significant step toward sustainable 
banking. Through eco-friendly shipping solutions, EBL is actively 
aligning with global climate commitments and strengthening its 
green finance portfolio.
In 2024, EBL organized multiple training programs in collaboration 
with Bangladesh Bank to enhance financial sector’s capacity in 
sustainable finance, ESRM guideline and ESG reporting. These 
sessions equipped banking professionals with knowledge on 
emerging sustainability regulations, IFRS S1 & S2 compliance, and 
the integration of climate risk assessment in financial decision-
making. 125 employees of EBL take part in the training session.
One of the key sessions, facilitated by the IFC Advisory Team, 
provided 60 EBL officials from diverse departments—including 
Corporate & SME Business, Credit Analysts, Risk Management, and 
Finance—with insights into climate risk mitigation strategies. Such 
proactive knowledge-sharing initiatives reinforce EBL’s leadership 
in sustainable finance and align the banking sector with global best 
practices.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
EBL partners with icddr,b for solid bio-hazardous waste management project and reverse osmosis 
EBL and internationally reputed research organization and hospital icddr,b entered into a collaborative partnership to support its initiatives 
of sold bio-hazardous waste management and reverse osmosis first in 2023. The collaboration grew into other initiatives in 2024: purified 
water for salinity prone areas.
Best Practices in Sustainable Solid Bio Hazardous Waste 
Management Phase-1
EBL and icddr,b joined partnership in a trailblazing initiative to 
improve healthcare waste management through sustainable and 
environment-friendly practices in January 2024. 
Previously, icddr,b was incinerating the entire solid biohazardous 
waste stream through a contracted vendor until April 2024. The 
majority of the solid biohazardous waste, generated in all the 
healthcare facilities, are contaminated polymers (plastic or rubber) 
materials with biological hazards. For complete destruction of the 
polymer materials and to stop its reuse, incineration is one way. 
As incineration involves high price as well as is burning value, 
icddr,b initiated best practices in sustainable solid biohazardous waste management and accordingly minimized the incineration cost, 
significantly reduced incineration, and  initiated recycling of plastic materials through plastic recycling facilities.
EBL initially contributed BDT 3.20 million in 2023 to icddr,b to set up an advanced solid biohazardous waste treatment facility. The facility 
will be equipped with advanced waste sterilizers and shredders, enabling the full decontamination and destruction of biohazardous 
polymer materials.
Biosafety Office of icddr,b has completed rigorous monitoring of icddr,b’s solid biohazardous waste management, starting from waste 
generation, proper segregation that follow transportation of the segregated and properly packaged solid wastes, with/without on-
site treatment from the temporary storage area to the biomedical waste treatment facility, for off-site treatment and final disposal. 
Accordingly, icddr,b has established best practices in sustainable solid biohazardous waste management in its premises starting from 
March to December in 2024.EBL partners with icddr,b for sustainable healthcare waste management
Best Practices in Sustainable Solid Bio Hazardous Waste Management Phase-2
In 2024, EBL has extended its support to a second phase of the Best Practices in Sustainable Solid Biohazardous Waste Management 
initiative at icddr,b by contributing BDT 3.50 million to the project. This phase will enhance waste treatment capacity at icddr,b by 
introducing advanced sterilization technology and providing training to key healthcare facilities in Dhaka. The program also aims to 
align national healthcare waste management policies with sustainable practices, ensuring a more environment-friendly and resilient 
healthcare system. Dr Asadulghani, Head of the Biosafety, Biorepository, and Containment Lab at icddr,b, will lead the implementation 
of this project.
Established waste autoclave facility (Left); waste converted to asset 
after sterilization (Right)
A seminar on “Best Practices in Sustainable Solid Biohazardous Waste 
Management” was held on 11 November 2024 organised by icddr,b’s 
Biosafety Office
The implementation of the project activity supported by EBL has minimized incineration and maximized recycling of 20% of the decontaminated 
polymer materials which is converted to asset. At the same time, a dedicated sterilization facility for waste management will help them to 
autoclave almost all the solid biohazardous waste, ensuring control of unintentional spread of infectious organisms from untreated biological 
waste while transporting. Until now, icddr,b and the neighboring community have definitely benefited from this project. 
The real impact will be evident when the Government facilities are aware of the updates on the new guidelines and the concerned key 
personnel from each facility are trained properly. With the full rollout of this project, Government facilities will be equipped to adopt 
sustainable best practices in line with the guidelines. Further support from government and non-government partners will be required to 
fill-up the gaps that are identified through the assessment procedures for full implementation of sustainable best practices. 
The partnership also includes developing and updating icddr,b’s policies and SOPs in line with sustainable practices. The project aims 
to promote similar initiatives across Bangladesh, with icddr,b hosting workshops and seminars to share its expertise in sustainable 
waste management with healthcare leaders and government officials. Through such endeavors, EBL stays true to its values in making 
true impacts in achieving environmentally sustainable society.

292Turning the Tide: Safe Drinking Water Brings Hope to Salinity-Stricken Families in Coastal Bangladesh
EBL has also pledged its support to icddr,b’s new initiative, “Purified Water for Salinity-Prone Areas: Overcoming Water Scarcity Challenges 
in Coastal Bangladesh.” This initiative will establish a reverse osmosis (RO) water treatment plant in Shyamnagar, Satkhira, one of the most 
salinity-affected regions in the country, to provide clean drinking water to 200 households. The project also includes a research component, 
where the blood pressure and urinary sodium levels of participants will be measured before the intervention and at 6-month and 12-month 
intervals afterward to evaluate the health impact of purified water. 
Shyamnagar, Satkhira – For years, the families of this coastal region have battled with an invisible yet relentless enemy—salinity intrusion. 
With freshwater sources increasingly contaminated, the simple act of drinking water has become a daily struggle, threatening both their health 
and livelihoods. Increased blood pressure, kidney diseases, skin diseases and diarrhea has become more prevalent in the last decade alongside 
increases in salinity of drinking water.
“We had no choice but to drink salty water. I have to walk for 30 minutes to buy fresh water from the market which is often not possible. My children 
often fell sick, and my husband’s health keep deteriorating. We knew it was the water, but what could we do?” says Hasina Begum, a mother of three, 
her voice heavy with years of hardship.
Now, a transformative initiative is bringing relief to 1,200 people in Datinakhali union of 
Shyamnagar. Environmental Health and WASH team of icddr,b is establishing a Reverse 
Osmosis (RO) water purification plant that will be providing families with clean and safe drinking 
water. RO-based desalination plants are being advocated as a climate-resilient option by both 
government and non-government organizations in response to the need for a long-term solution 
in southwest coastal Bangladesh. 
For many, this intervention is life-changing. “I feel hopeful that my children will grow up drinking 
fresh water, there is nothing more satisfactory to us than drinking a glass of fresh water, ” says 
Rashidul Islam, a local fisherman.
This project aims to reduce salinity-related health risks, particularly high blood pressure and 
kidney health, by supplying purified water and assessing its impact on community health through 
a rigorous scientific assessment. Evidence generated from this project will also help to project the 
health benefits over cost to policy makers and encourage future investment in safe drinking water 
in coastal Bangladesh.
Beyond health benefits, the project will explore the economic and social feasibility of scaling up RO-
based water supply models in other climate-vulnerable regions. Community engagement through 
surveys, interviews, and water quality testing ensures that this initiative is not just a short-term 
solution but a sustainable model for the future.
By aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG-6)—ensuring clean water and sanitation for 
all—this initiative is more than a local intervention; it is a beacon of hope for communities for all the 
coastal regions facing the dire consequences of climate-induced salinity intrusion.
EBL believes in pushing the boundaries of traditional corporate responsibility. And hence, 
supporting such initiatives where environmental sustainability meets public health. EBL does not 
just invest in projects; in fact, we invest in the future of the communities.
EBL Provides Water Bottle Distribution during 
2024 Heat Wave 
In response to the scorching heat wave of summer 2024, EBL took 
proactive measures to support the communities in Dhaka and Chattogram by distributing water bottles. This initiative was aimed 
at alleviating the discomfort caused by extreme temperatures, 
ensuring hydration and well-being for individuals working in the 
heat. Through this effort, EBL was able to contribute to the social 
welfare and provide some relief to the people during heatwaves.
EBL partners with NKFTCL for coastal forestation and tree plantation on Bhasanchar Island
EBL took initiative for coastal forestation and tree plantation on Bhasanchar Island in a collaboration with Nou Kollan Foundation 
Trading Company Limited (NKFTCL), Bangladesh Navy. This project represents a significant step towards environmental restoration 
and coastal protection focusing on planting a variety of trees that serve multiple purposes. A diverse range of fruit-bearing, medicinal 
and environment-friendly trees will be planted to strengthen the coastal belt that will enhance biodiversity and improve the ecological 
balance of the area.
EBL contributes BDT 3.80 million for coastal forestation and the plantation program 
This tree plantation project is not merely an act of planting trees, 
it includes a detailed post-plantation care program to ensure 
the long-term growth and sustainability of these trees. Regular 
monitoring, soil enrichment and other support mechanisms 
will be in place to maximize the environmental impact of this 
initiative. By promoting the growth of such diverse species, the 
project aims to mitigate soil erosion, provide resources for local 
communities and improve the resilience of Bhasanchar Island’s 
ecosystem against the impacts of climate change.

Empowering grassroots women entrepreneurs: A

EBL Women Banking went into partnership with PUM, a purpose-
driven organization with skilled, dedicated, and entrepreneurial 
experts from Netherlands, and Trinamul Nari Uddyakta Society, a 
membership-based group of grassroots women entrepreneurs in 
Bangladesh.
They conducted a 10-day train-the-trainer program in Sylhet 
for 20 experienced entrepreneurs selected by Trinamul from 
various regions. The goal was to empower these participants with 
practical knowledge to assist emerging women entrepreneurs in 
the fashion sector within grassroots communities. This training 
focused on enhancing their capacity to better understand consumer 
preferences and market demand to boost sales.EBL introduces online training program for 
women entrepreneurs
In Bangladesh, women entrepreneurs are rewriting the rules of 
economic empowerment despite societal barriers. Many women 
entrepreneurs lack formal training in business management, 
marketing, or financial literacy. These gaps often hinder the 
scalability of their ventures, making it harder to compete in an 
increasingly digital and globalized economy. 
To reduce the gap, EBL has introduced “Financial Literacy and 
Entrepreneur Development Training” program exclusively designed 
for women entrepreneurs. Curated by ADB and Bangladesh 
Bank, the online training program aims at empowering women 
entrepreneurs in Bangladesh. This self-paced training provides 
practical knowledge, assessments, and certification, helping women 
borrowers from small enterprises enhance their business success.

adapted to the changing financial landscape by prioritizing service

Retail & SME Loans
Retail Loan
In 2024, inflation peaked in the country and during these challenging 
times EBL Retail Loan acted as a much-needed financing source for 
the clients with suitable products tailored to their needs. As a result, 
our retail loan portfolio reached to around BDT 30,628 million at 
year end. Amid several socio-economic challenges starting from 
the volatility of interest rate to country’s socio-political turmoil, we 
achieved a portfolio growth of about BDT 2,313 million, with a 12% 
growth in EMI based retail loan portfolio. Following the motto of ensuring sustainable growth of portfolio 
without compromising loan quality, we successfully maintained a 
low retail NPL rate of 1.59%.
SME Loans
As we focused on the need for a more stable and sustainable 
asset base, we prioritized on secured lending in 2024. Hence, SME 
business segment demonstrated resilience, achieving a significant 
growth of BDT 5,138 million. This growth was primarily driven by 
our strategic focus on mortgage-backed loans, which accounted for 
95% of the portfolio expansion. 
In 2024, we launched EBL Shohoz – a product designed for small 
entrepreneurs. This innovative product has been launched to reach 
a broader client base and strengthen SME financing support for 
emerging businesses.

which has kept EBL relevant throughout the year. Some of the major 
products launched during the year are:

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Treasury, FIs & Offshore Banking
Bangladesh continues to demonstrate resilience in navigating 
economic challenges amid persistent inflationary pressures and 
structural weaknesses. Real GDP growth slowed to 4.22% in FY 2024 
(Source: BBS) compared to 5.78% in FY 2023, reflecting subdued 
domestic consumption and weakened export demand. Inflation 
remained elevated with the twelve-month average of 10.34% in 
December 2024, driven by supply chain disruptions and global 
market volatility. In response, Bangladesh Bank implemented 
contractionary monetary policies to stabilize the economy, 
including a repo rate hike to 10%, the removal of lending rate caps, 
and a market-driven crawling peg exchange rate adjustment. 
These measures aimed to curb inflationary pressures and enhance 
macroeconomic stability.Despite these challenges, the digital transformation continued 
to drive innovation across key sectors, contributing to economic 
resilience and inclusive growth. The expanding middle-class 
consumer base supported domestic demand, while efforts to 
diversify exports gained momentum. 
Eastern Bank’s Treasury maintained a significant contribution to 
revenue streams, effectively managing market risks and ensuring 
robust performance in a complex macroeconomic environment. 
Its strategic approach reinforced the Bank’s financial stability, 
underscoring its resilience amid evolving market conditions.
Strategic Focus in 2024
To navigate the evolving and challenging market conditions of 
2024, EBL focused on the following key areas:
• Optimizing the asset-liability structure to enhance interest 
rate spreads and maintain balance sheet stability in a volatile 
financial environment.• Strengthening liquidity management strategies to navigate 
tightening market conditions and rising interest rates, 
ensuring agility in financial risk management.
• Expanding foreign currency liquidity by deepening 
relationships with key remittance partners and leveraging 
growth in both export and remittance businesses to increase 
FCY inflows.Organogram of Treasury, FIs & Offshore Banking

Money Market 
In 2024, Bangladesh’s local currency liquidity faced significant 
pressure due to increased government borrowing and a surge 
in industrial term loan disbursements. This strain led to a rapid 
depletion of excess reserves and liquid assets, indicating heightened 
demand for local currency. 
To combat persistent inflation, Bangladesh Bank raised the policy 
(repo) rate by 2.25% throughout 2024 to reach 10%, the highest so 
far. Bangladesh Bank also abandoned the SMART rate in favor of a 
fully market-based lending rate, allowing banks greater flexibility to 
set rates based on market dynamics and funding costs. In the interbank market, the average call money volume declined, 
while call money rates surged significantly in response to policy 
rate hikes and reduced liquidity in the broader economy. The call 
money rate increased by 2.92% in the first half and by 2.50% in the 
second half compared to those of previous year.
Commercial banks increasingly relied on the repo mechanism, 
as evidenced by a substantial 56% year-on-year increase in repo 
utilization. This trend was primarily driven by reduced liquidity in 
the money market and the central bank’s initiative to implement a 
weekly repo mechanism with extended tenure of 14 and 28 days.Market share of EBL & Other Banks in 2024

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Eastern Bank PLC. prudently managed its liquidity during 
challenging times, ensuring full compliance with regulatory 
requirements while contributing to EBL’s revenue significantly. 
Foreign Exchange Market 
In 2024, Bangladesh’s foreign exchange market experienced 
significant developments aimed at stabilizing the economy and 
enhancing market efficiency. On May 8, 2024, Bangladesh Bank 
introduced a crawling peg system, linking the Taka’s value to a 
currency basket aligned with the Real Effective Exchange Rate 
(REER) Index. This initiative sought to reduce market volatility and 
narrow the gap between formal and informal exchange rates.
Additionally, foreign exchange policy liberalization efforts, such as 
the enactment of the Offshore Banking Act 2024, with expectation 
to bolster foreign exchange inflows and alleviate exchange rate 
pressures. Furthermore, EBL strengthened its correspondent 
banking relationships and diversified its foreign currency funding 
sources, positioning itself advantageously in the competitive 
banking sector. Our commitment to prudent risk management and 
strategic adaptability underscored the role as a leading financial 
institution in Bangladesh during a year of significant economic 
transformation. Asset-liability Management (ALM)
Asset-liability management is a dynamic process of planning, 
organizing & controlling of assets & liabilities- their volumes, mixes, 
maturities, yields and costs in order to maintain liquidity and net 
interest income (NII). In the banking sector, effective ALM is crucial 
for managing inflationary pressures, interest rate fluctuations, and 
liquidity constraints.
In 2024, the Bank showed resilience and adaptability by proactively 
managing its balance sheet amid evolving market conditions.  EBL 
implemented dynamic strategies to maintain financial stability 
and optimize performance. The Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO) 
remained vigilant in monitoring critical regulatory parameters, 
including Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), and Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR) and the Maximum Cumulative Outflow (MCO), ensuring 
compliance and reinforcing financial resilience.
ALCO focus areas in 2024
• Strengthening liquidity management to navigate market 
uncertainties.
• Expanding investments in government securities to enhance 
balance sheet stability.
• Mitigating financial volatility through prudent risk assessment 
and management.
• Driving sustainable balance sheet growth while maintaining 
regulatory compliance.
EBL’s robust ALM practices in 2024 underscored its commitment to 
strong governance and financial resilience, ensuring stability and 
value creation for customers and stakeholders.
Business Development and Remittance
As a trade-focused bank, EBL actively pursues sustainable foreign 
currency inflows to meet client needs. Despite various challenges, 
EBL reached a significant milestone in 2024, securing USD 506.53 
million inward remittances.
Throughout the year, EBL on-boarded leading remittance industry 
players, including Taptap Send, Tranglo, TerraPay, HelloPaisa, and 
DigitNine, with additional partnerships in progress. Additionally, 
EBL collaborated with StoneX (NASDAQ: SNEX) and JP Morgan 
Chase Bank to facilitate inward remittance services for their global 
clients, including prominent multinational corporations and UN 
organizations such as UNICEF, UNHCR, UNESCO, WHO, and CISCO.
EBL is committed to maintaining and continuously enhancing 
its services to ensure seamless payment experiences for its 
customers. The Bank remains dedicated to innovation, offering 
fast, secure, and efficient financial solutions, particularly for wage 
earners’ remittances. Recognizing the critical role of remittances, Amid these macroeconomic changes, EBL demonstrated resilience 
and strategic foresight. We effectively navigated through the 
evolving foreign exchange landscape by leveraging policy shifts and 
market opportunities. EBL’s proactive approach included enhancing 
foreign exchange risk management practices and optimizing its 
foreign currency asset-liability positions. These measures ensured 
compliance with regulatory changes and contributed to the Bank’s 
profitability.
Fixed Income Securities Market
Higher returns on fixed-income instruments attracted increased 
participation from individual investors, a trend further supported 
by Bangladesh Bank’s efforts to simplify the investment process 
in government securities. Despite rising interest rates, outright 
transactions in Government Securities (G-Sec) reached BDT 120,000 
crore in FY 2023–24.
EBL played a pivotal role in this evolving market, contributing 21% to 
total market turnover—a significant rise from 6.60% in the previous 
year. Additionally, EBL’s revenue from the fixed-income securities 
market grew by 16%, highlighting its strategic positioning and 
effective management in a challenging economic environment.Major Currencies against BDT in 2024

Inbound Business & China Desk
EBL is the first Bangladeshi bank to establish a presence in 
China. Its representative office, located in Guangzhou, Guangdong 
Province, commenced operations in 2019 with a strategic mission 
to strengthen financial and trade relationships between Bangladesh 
and China. This office primarily serves as a business referral hub, 
facilitating connections between Eastern Bank’s headquarters in 
Dhaka and the vast Chinese business community. Since it operates 
solely as a liaison office, it does not engage in any direct revenue-
generating activities.
A key function of the Guangzhou Representative Office is the collection 
of outstanding guarantee commissions from various Chinese banks. 
These commissions are linked to counter-guarantees issued by 
Chinese banks, for which Eastern Bank PLC. in Bangladesh provides 
local guarantees. Through consistent follow-ups and negotiations, 
the office ensures the efficient collection of these dues.
In addition to facilitating financial recoveries, the Guangzhou 
Representative Office plays a vital role in expanding Eastern Bank’s 
banking services within the Chinese market. It assists Chinese 
companies in opening accounts with EBL in Dhaka, enabling 
smoother cross-border transactions. The office also actively works 
towards establishing Relationship Management Agreement (RMA) 
relationships with various Chinese banks, fostering stronger 
banking collaboration. Furthermore, it engages with Chinese 
financial institutions to encourage the establishment of credit 
limits for EBL, thereby enhancing trade financing opportunities for 
businesses operating between Bangladesh and China.The Guangzhou Representative Office has significantly boosted EBL’s 
visibility in the Chinese business community. Notably, it was the 
first Bangladeshi bank to participate in the prestigious Canton Fair 
in Guangzhou in 2024, enhancing the Bank’s brand recognition and 
establishing it as a key financial partner in Bangladesh-China trade.
With a strategic presence in China, Eastern Bank PLC. enhances 
cross-border banking relationships and promotes deeper 
financial integration between the two countries. The Guangzhou 
Representative Office plays a crucial role in driving the bank’s 
growth and expanding its global influence through its ongoing 
efforts in financial facilitation, business referrals, and international 
partnerships.
International Business & Offshore Banking
Our unwavering commitment to excellence, high-quality clientele, 
and sustainable financial services has gradually earned the trust 
and support of our financial institution (FI) correspondents. Here 
are the key highlights of 2024:
International Trade Finance Support: In order to support the 
international trade, EBL sourced substantial foreign currency 
(FCY) fund amounting to USD 223 million from international 
banking partners and USD 70 million from Development Financial 
Institutions for EBL Offshore Banking Operation (OBO). To expand 
the clients’ international trade operations, EBL also provided Letter 
of Credit (LC) services by arranging LC confirmation and financing 
worth USD 469 million from various large foreign banks. Moreover, 
EBL’s OBO facilitated LC Financing to the tune of USD 203 million. 
We have also restarted availing trade finance support under Global 
Trade Finance Program of International Finance Corporation (IFC).
Sustainability Initiatives: We have completed the Shadow 
Implementation plan of Environmental and Social Management 
System (ESMS) of Asian Development Bank (ADB) with support of 
ERM Vietnam.
Credit Guarantee Facility: We have completed the initial due 
diligence of ADB’s Microfinance Risk Participation Program 
(MFP) which is a credit enhancement and a risk-allocation tool, 
designed to address this gap and promote local currency lending to 
microfinance institutions (MFIs).
Banking Network Expansion: We have established RMA with 24 
banks such as ABC International Bank PLC., Royal Bank of Canada, 
US Bank National Association etc. These new relationships will 
increase EBL’s global transaction capabilities. 
Guarantees: EBL has long been a preferred partner for foreign 
financial institutions in issuing guarantees for large-scale 
infrastructure projects, which is a testament to its role as a key 
player in Bangladesh’s financial sector. Historically, the majority of 
EBL’s guarantees are issued in the second half of the year, aligning 
with the approval timelines of major projects.
• Strengthening liquidity buffers to mitigate funding pressures amid rising government borrowing and tightening market liquidity.
• Enhancing engagement with Non-Resident Bangladeshi (NRB) stakeholders to boost remittance inflows and strengthen foreign 
currency liquidity.
• Optimizing balance sheet management and government securities to earn higher return.
• Diversifying funding sources to reduce reliance on short-term borrowings and enhance financial stability.
• Leveraging data-driven insights and digital solutions to optimize treasury operations and risk management.Way forward

to the overall stagnation in trading activities.
Despite all the challenges, EBLSL has shown resilience, securing top

EBLSL had to maintain higher provision against its capital market

contribution to the development and progress of the country’s capital market.
Market Expectations for 2025
The capital market is expected to navigate through a challenging landscape in 2025 
amid ongoing political and economic pressures. However, improving macroeconomic 
indicators—rising exports, remittances, stabilized forex reserves, and potential foreign 
funding—offer hope for recovery. Bangladesh Bank’s inflation control measures, 
including policy rate hikes, aim to curb inflation by mid-2025. 
However, depending on clarity surrounding the next parliamentary elections, political 
stability could take hold in the later half of the year. Additionally, global fund manager 
Asia Frontier Capital (AFC) also projects a modest revival in Bangladesh’s stock market 
in the second half of 2025. Unlike 2024, companies with sound fundamentals and good 
governance from Banks/Financial Institutions, FMCG, Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals 
and Food & Allied sector are expected to remain resilient in 2025, while companies 
from Engineering, Construction, Fuel & Power and Textiles may remain subdued. 
Throughout the year, the DSEX index may hover around 5,000-5,800 points, while the 
average daily turnover is projected to remain around BDT 5 to 7 billion. KEY DRIVERS
• Anticipated moderate improvement in the 
macroeconomic landscape. 
• Persistently high interest rates in the 
money market, with gradual easing 
expected due to lower credit demand.
• Political uncertainties surrounding the 
next parliamentary elections.
• Regulatory initiatives to boost investor 
confidence and enhance market 
participation.
• Ensuring effective monitoring of Margin Loan.

Employee benefits
Financial benefits
EBL offers a competitive financial benefit package that includes 
increment, festival bonus, performance bonus, employee home loan, 
employee car loan, retirement benefits etc. Due to our wide range of 
financial benefits, we aim to retain and motivate our employees to 
contribute towards our organization.We believe in equal opportunity employment and do not discriminate 
our employees based on race, gender and ethnicity. As a result, the 
compensation and benefit packages are similar for all employees 
regardless of gender, race and ethnicity. All these benefits are 
streamlined and have been specified in our People Management 
Policy.
Superannuation fund
EBL has grade wise superannuation fund scheme to provide benefit 
to the employees in case of death or disability. In case of death of 
an employee, his/her nominee and/or heirs will get 100% amount 
of the ceiling and in case of disability he/she will get full/partial 
amount of the ceiling based on severity of disability.
Critical illness fund
As per EBL People Management Policy, all EBL employees are 
entitled to hospitalization benefits. The entitlements are up to 03 
(three) times of the basic salary of the employee. However, there 
has been cases where the nature of the illness of the employee is so 
grave that regular entitlements do not suffice.  Recognizing this, the 
honorable Board of Directors of EBL has approved a “Critical Illness 
Fund” to handle the catastrophic medical situations. 
“Critical Illness Fund” is an addition to hospitalization reimbursement 
and it provides a lump-sum payment to cover medical expenses and 
financial burdens associated with severe life-threatening medical 
conditions such as cancer, heart attack, stroke, organ failure, etc. 
This is a humane approach to support the employees when they 
need it the most. 
In 2024, a total of 8 employees got benefits from this fund to cover 
the treatment expenses for them/their dependents for diseases like 
cancer, stroke, kidney failure, etc. 
Employee leave benefits
Employee leave benefits are structured and specified in our People 
Management Policy. All permanent employees are entitled to 28 
working days and trainee employees get 10 working days as annual 
leave which includes compliance leave of 10 days for permanent Increment

324Employee engagement
We value our people for whom we believe that we have created 
a Home of Happiness. We also put our effort in creating an 
environment that is valuable for both personal and professional 
growth. We are not afraid to push boundaries. We innovate by going 
beyond the impossible to achieve greatness. Let’s take a glimpse 
into what makes us different from others.
Equal opportunity, career progression & 
diversity
There are different views as to what constitutes equal opportunities. 
Nonetheless, it is possible to define this as combined efforts, equal 
participation and shared responsibilities regardless of gender, 
ethnicity, disability, age, religious belief and marital status. In 
brief, here the term “equal opportunities” upholds the idea that all 
employees including the pre-employment phase should be entitled 
to have access to all of the basic facilities.
• Providing equal opportunity to everyone.
• Creating a work environment free from discrimination.• Evaluating employee’s performance based on ability, 
experience, and potential.
• Recruiting someone based on individual’s ability to perform, 
experience and potential. 
Grievance management 
We have a well-written grievance management policy. We also have 
a speak-up policy and sexual harassment-free workplace committee 
headed by a female leader. We try to protect employees’ rights which 
is backed by our code of conduct and service excellence policy. Our 
grievance management approaches are as follows:

Customer retention activities
With rapid growth of digitalization, emerging technologies and constant shift in banking dynamics, the financial industry is highly competitive 
now. This brings various challenges for business to thrive and can cause significant impact in attrition of clients. Despite these challenges 
and rising competition, EBL delivers sustainable business growth by constantly nurturing its valued customers through quality service and 
retention activities. EBL rigorously monitors business attrition trends and prioritizes taking feedbacks from outgoing customers as well as 
relationship managers which eventually helps us to identify the root causes of business erosion and areas for improvement.  EBL remains 
resilient in navigating the challenges of the country’s changing economic and financial landscape and hence, following proactive measures 
are taken in 2024 to retain customers:Complaint cell

Thank you for fostering such a dedicated and competent team. I hope Ms. Y will be recognized for her hard work and 
continued contributions.

Each quarter, low balance accounts are identified 
and nurtured through fund-generation projects. 
Customers are made aware of financial benefits 
through SMS with engaging content on interest 
earning and account utilization. This results 
in revival of customers who were deemed as 
outgoing.With the intention to retain outgoing payroll 
clients with no salary reflection, EBL raised 
awareness among 30,000 payroll clients 
encouraging them to convert their accounts to 
regular savings product to reap the financial 
benefits that we offer. Thus, we effectively 
retained multiple payroll clients.
EBL remains dedicated to enhancing service quality and ensuring customer delight by leveraging digitalization initiatives, utilizing customer 
insights and optimizing operational efficiency. Hence moving ahead, we will have our focus on increasing efficiency of providing services 
through advancing our digitalization endeavors, expanding easy access to financial services and aligning product propositions to meet the 
diverse customer needs. Our goal is to promote a culture of service excellence through continuous training and capacity building initiatives as 
well as improving robust mechanisms for efficient and transparent complaint resolution.Way forward

342INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 
To the Shareholders of Eastern Bank PLC.
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Eastern Bank PLC. and its subsidiaries (the "Group") as well as the separate 
financial statements of Eastern Bank PLC. (the "Bank"), which comprise the consolidated and separate Balance Sheets as at 31 December 
2024, and consolidated and separate Profit and Loss Accounts, consolidated and separate statement of Changes in Equity, and consolidated 
and separate Cash Flow Statements for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and separate financial statements of the Bank give a true 
and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the separate financial position of the Bank as at 31 December 2024, and 
of its consolidated and separate financial performance and its consolidated and separate cash flows for the year then ended in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as explained in note-2.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Bank in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), rules & regulations issued by Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC), and 
Bangladesh Bank, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code and the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) Bye-Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw attention to note # 2.12 of the financial statements, where the management of the bank described about  voluntary change in 
accounting policy for subsequent measurement basis of the bank’s land reversion from “revaluation model to cost model”. Our opinion 
remains unmodified in respect of this matter.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated and 
separate financial statements for the financial year 2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated 
and separate financial statements as a whole, and informing auditors’ opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. For each matter described below our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, 
including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment 
of the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements. These results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed 
to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

FINANCIAL REPORTS
Description of key audit matters Our response to key audit matters
1. Measurement of provision for loans, advances/investments
With reference to Note 13.8 to the financial statements, the process 
for calculating the provision for loans, advances/investments portfolio 
associated with credit risk is significant and complex. The Bank calculates 
provision for loans, advances/investments by considering various factors 
such as rate of provision, loan category, expiry date, outstanding balance, 
interest suspense amount, value of eligible collateral as per BRPD circular 
no. 14 dated 23 September 2012 and its subsequent amendments. 
To minimize COVID-19 impact, Bangladesh Bank issued BRPD Circular 
Letter No.56 dated 10 December 2020 related to BRPD Circular No. 17 dated 
28 September 2020; BRPD circular No.52 dated 29 December 2021 related 
to BRPD Circular No. 19 dated 26 August 2021 and BRPD Circular No. 51 
dated 22 December 2022 related to BRPD Circular No.-14 dated 22 June 
2022 for providing deferral facility to aggrieved customers.
According to the circulars, commercial banks must keep an extra provision 
(Special General Provision-COVID-19) for those borrowers who have availed of 
payment by deferral (PBD) facilities. The calculation of the new provisioning 
rule will have to be implemented based on the outstanding loans (deferral 
payment) as of 31 December 2020, 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022. 
As per BRPD Circular No. 58 dated December 31, 2024, the Special General 
Provision for COVID-19 has been repelled and EBL has reversed the 
provision (383.30 million) as per circular during the year.
In Bangladesh, non-performing loans have been increasing day by day. 
Banks need to maintain provisions for additional non-performing loans 
in line with the central bank’s guidelines. The Bank identifies impaired 
loan accounts and calculates required provisions manually. Furthermore, 
management has incentive to maintain lower provisions for loans and 
advances to misstate profit. Considering these factors, we have considered 
measurement of provision for loans, advances/investments and leases as 
significant risk as well as a key audit matter.
At the year end of 2024 the Group reported total gross loans, advances/
investments and leases of BDT 412,818.77 million (2023: BDT 355,904.89  
million) and in 2024 the Bank reported total gross loans, advances/investments 
and leases of BDT 410,717.61 million (2023: BDT 353,356.93 million) whereas 
at the year end of 2024 the Group reported total provision for loans, advances/
investments and leases of BDT 14,713.75 million (2023: BDT 15,055.96 million) 
and the Bank reported total provision for loans, advances/investments and 
leases of BDT 14,251.42 million (2023: BDT 14,717.04  million). We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key 
controls focusing on the following:
• Credit appraisal, loan disbursement procedures, 
monitoring and provisioning process;
• Identification of loss events, including early warning and 
default warning indicators;
• Review of quarterly Classification of Loans (CL).
Our substantive procedures in relation to the provision for 
loans and advances portfolio comprised the following:
For confirming the classification of rescheduled lease, loans 
and advances. we performed the following procedures:
• We checked the no. of instalments outstanding and 
compliance with BRPD Circular No. 16 dated 18 July 
2022;
• Reviewed the adequacy of the general and specific 
provisions in line with related Bangladesh Bank 
guidelines;
• Tested the inputs in computation of provision in terms of 
testing the accuracy of underlying information;
• Assessed the methodologies on which the provision 
amounts based (value of eligible securities, interest 
suspense), recalculated the provisions for lease, loans 
and advances; and
We assessed the appropriateness and presentation of 
disclosure against relevant accounting standards and 
Bangladesh Bank guidelines
See note no. 13.8 to the financial statements
2. Recognition of interest income on loans, advances/investments
Recognition of interest income has significant and wide influence on 
financial statements. Recognition and measurement of interest income 
have involved complex IT environments. 
We identify recognition of interest income from loans, advances/
investments and leases as a key audit matter because this is one of the 
key performance indicators of the Bank and therefore there is an inherent 
risk of fraud and error and misstatement in recognition of interest by 
management to meet specific targets or expectations. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key 
controls over recognition and measurement of interest on 
loans, advances/investments and leases focusing on the 
following.
• We performed test of operating effectiveness on 
automated control in place to measure and recognize 
interest income.
• We have also performed substantive procedure to check 
whether interest income is recognized completely and 
accurately.
• Reviewing transfer of interests to the income account in 
line with the Bangladesh Bank’s guidelines
• We assessed the appropriateness and presentation of 
disclosure against relevant accounting standards and 
Bangladesh Bank guidelines.
• We performed procedures to ensure that the revenue 
recognition criteria adopted by each group entity for all 
major revenue streams is appropriate and in line with 
the Group’s accounting policies
See note no. 22.3 to the financial statements

3. Valuation of treasury bill and treasury bond
The classification and measurement of T-Bill and T-Bond require judgment 
and complex estimates.
In the absence of a quoted price in an active market, the fair value of T-Bills 
and T-Bonds is determined using complex valuation techniques which 
may take into consideration direct or indirect unobservable market data 
and complex pricing models which require an elevated level of judgment.We assessed the processes and controls put in place by the 
Bank to identify and confirm the existence of treasury bills 
and bonds.
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and 
tested the operating effectiveness of the key controls over 
the treasury bills and bonds valuation processes, including 
controls over market data inputs into valuation models, 
model governance and valuation adjustments.
We tested a sample of the valuation models and the inputs 
used in those models, using a variety of techniques, including 
comparing inputs to available market data.
Finally assessed the appropriateness and presentation of 
disclosures against relevant accounting standards and 
Bangladesh Bank guidelines.
See note no. 6 to the financial statements
4. IT systems and controls
Our audit procedures have a focus on IT systems and controls due to the 
pervasive nature and complexity of the IT environment, the large volume 
of transactions processed in numerous locations daily and the reliance on 
automated and IT dependent manual controls.
Our areas of audit focus included user access management, developer 
access to the production environment and changes to the IT environment. 
These are key to ensuring IT dependent and application-based controls are 
operating effectively.We tested the design and operating effectiveness of the 
Bank’s IT access controls over the information systems that 
are critical to financial reporting.
We tested IT general controls (logical access, changes 
management and aspects of IT operational controls). This 
included testing that requests for access to systems were 
appropriately reviewed and authorized.
We tested the Bank’s periodic review of access rights and 
reviewed requests of changes to systems for appropriate 
approval and authorization.
We considered the control environment relating to various 
interfaces, configurations and other application layer controls 
identified as key to our audit.
We performed the tests of IT general controls to evaluate the 
application development and database, hosting platforms 
and segregation of incompatible duties relevant to application 
and database change management.
Other Matter
The financial statements of Eastern Bank PLC. and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year ended December 31, 2023, were audited by 
another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on March 14, 2024.
Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than 
the consolidated and separate financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be made available to 
us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated and separate financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing 
to report in this regard.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024345
FINANCIAL REPORTS
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements and Internal Controls
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group and also separate 
financial statements of the Bank in accordance with IFRSs as explained in note-2 and for such internal control as management determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated and separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error. The Bank Company Act, 1991 and the Bangladesh Bank Regulations require the Management to ensure effective 
internal audit, internal control and risk management functions of the Bank. The Management is also required to make a self-assessment on 
the effectiveness of anti-fraud internal controls and report to Bangladesh Bank on instances of fraud and forgeries.
In preparing the consolidated and separate financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Bank’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management either intends to liquidate the Group and the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s and the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated and separate financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and separate financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made 
by management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the 
Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated and separate financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group and the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated and separate financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the consolidated and separate financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh 
the public interest benefits of such communication.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024361
FINANCIAL REPORTS
In addition to the aforementioned directives and standards, the operation of Islamic Banking is governed by BRPD Circular No. 15 
issued by Bangladesh Bank dated November 9, 2009 and in compliance with the Standards issued by the Accounting and Auditing 
Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) and Shariah Principles.
The balance sheet and profit and loss account of Islamic Banking Operation are incorporated with main operation (DBO). Separate 
financial statements for the Islamic Operation for the year ended 31 December 2024 have also been prepared and included in the 
annual report 2024.
Material departures from the requirements of IFRSs are as follows:
i) Presentation of financial statements
IFRSs: As per IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, financial statements shall comprise  a statement of financial position 
as at the end of the period, a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the period, a statement of changes 
in equity for the period, a statement of cash flows for the period and notes - comprising significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information. As per IAS 1, the entity shall also present current and non-current assets and liabilities as separate 
classifications in its statement of financial position.
Bangladesh Bank: The presentation of the financial statements in prescribed format (i.e. balance sheet, profit and loss account, 
cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity, liquidity statement) and certain disclosures therein are guided by the First 
Schedule (section 38) of the Bank Company Act 1991 (as amendment up to date) and BRPD circular no. 14 dated 25 June 2003 
and subsequent guidelines of Bangladesh Bank. In the prescribed format there is no option to present assets and liabilities under 
current and non-current classifications.
ii) Investment in equity instruments (shares, mutual funds, etc.) except investment in subsidiaries 
IFRSs: As per requirements of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, classification and measurement of investment in equity instruments 
(shares & securities) depend on the nature of their contractual cash flows as well as how these are managed (the entity's business 
model). Based on these factors, it generally falls either under 'at fair value through profit and loss account' or 'at fair value through 
other comprehesive income'. Any subsequent change in the fair value at the year-end is recongnized to profit and loss account or 
other comprehensive income depending on the entity's business model. 
Bangladesh Bank: Provision for diminution of value of quoted shares, mutual funds (closed-end) and bonds has been made on 
'portfolio basis' netting off gain following DOS circular letter no. 1  dated 24 May 2023 and provision for diminution of value of 
unquoted shares and mutual funds has been made on the basis of net worth (Assets - Liabilities) of shares and surrender price 
of mutual funds respectively. 
The Bank reviews its investment in shares & mutual funds at each quarter-end on mark-to-market basis and has maintained a 
cumulative provision of BDT 1,646.47 million as on 31-12-2024 as per circulars issued by Bangladesh Bank (note 13.14).
iii) Revaluation gain/loss on government securities
IFRSs: Government securities refer primarily to various debt instruments which include both Treasury Bond and Treasury Bills. 
As per IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, treasury bills (T-bills)/treasury bonds (T-bonds) are measured 'at fair value through other 
comprehensive income' where gains or losses are recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI), except for impairment gains 
or losses and foreign exchange gains and losses. The loss allowance arisen from impairment is recognised in OCI and does not 
reduce the carrying amount of financial assets in the financial position. Securities designated as amortized cost are measured at 
effective interest rate method and related interest income is recognized in profit and loss account. 
Bangladesh Bank: According to DOS circular no. 5 dated 26 May 2008 and subsequent clarification in DOS circular no. 5 dated 28 
January 2009, amortization gain/loss is charged to profit and loss account, mark-to-market loss on revaluation of government 
securities (T-bills/T-bonds) categorised as Held for Trading (HFT) is charged to profit and loss account, but any unrealised gain on 
such revaluation is recognised to revaluation reserve account. Securities designated as Held to Maturity (HTM) are measured at 
amortised cost method but income/gain is recognised through equity.
iv) Provision on loans and advances, off-balance sheet exposures including other commitments
IFRSs: As per IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, an entity shall recognize an impairment allowances on Loans and advances following 
Expected Credit Losses (ECL) model and shall subsequently remeasure the impairment allowances on Loans and advances at 
each reporting date. If the credit risk on these Loans and advances increase significantly, an entity shall measure the impairment 
allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. 
If the credit risk on these Loans and advances does not increase significantly, an entity shall measure the impairment allowances 
equivalent to 12 months ECL that may result from default events on such Loans and advances within 12 months after reporting 
period.   

--- Page 364 ---
362Bangladesh Bank: As per Bangladesh Bank instructions through different circulars, general provision (GP) ranging from 0.25% 
to 2% on different categories of unclassified loans (standard/SMA loans) and specific provision ranging from 5% to 100% on 
classified loan accounts including certain rescheduled loan accounts to be made netting off eligible securities (if any). Also, a 
general provision ranging from 0.5% - 1% to be provided for certain off-balance sheet exposures (including other commitments). 
Such provision policies are not specifically in line with those prescribed by IFRS 9.
The Bank maintained a cumulative general provision of BDT 6,872.65 million (general provision of BDT 5,418.75 million for 
unclassified loans & advances, and BDT 1,453.90 million for off-balance sheet exposures) and specific provision of BDT 8,832.67 
million for classified, rescheduled and stay order accounts on 31 December 2024 (note 13.8).
v) Other comprehensive income and appropriation of profit
IFRSs:  As per IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, other comprehensive income (OCI) is a component of financial 
statements or the elements of OCI are to be included in a single other comprehensive income (OCI) statement. IFRSs do not require 
appropriation of profit to be shown on the face of the statement of comprehensive income.
Bangladesh Bank: The templates of financial statements issued by Bangladesh Bank do not include other comprehensive 
income nor are the elements of other comprehensive income allowed to be included in a single other comprehensive income 
(OCI) statement. As such the Bank does not prepare the other comprehensive income statement. However, elements of OCI, if any, 
are shown in the statement of changes in equity. Furthermore, the above templates require disclosure of appropriation of profit 
on the face of profit and loss account.
vi) Financial instruments - presentation and disclosure
As per BB guidelines, in certain cases financial instruments are categorized, recognized, measured and presented differently from 
those prescribed in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments - Disclosures and IFRS 9  Financial 
Instruments. As such, some disclosures and presentation requirements of IAS 32, IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 cannot be fully made in these 
financial statements.
vii) Repo and reverse repo transactions
IFRSs: As per requirements of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, when an entity sells a financial asset and simultaneously enters 
into an agreement to repurchase the same (or a similar asset) at a fixed price on a future date (REPO or stock lending), the 
arrangement is accounted for as a collateralized borrowing and the underlying asset continues to be recognised in the entity’s 
financial statements. This transaction will be treated as borrowing and the difference between selling price and repurchase price 
will be treated as interest expense. The same rule applies to the opposite side of the transaction (reverse repo).
Bangladesh Bank: As per Bangladesh Bank circulars/guidelines, when a Bank sells a financial asset and simultaneously enters 
into an agreement to repurchase the same (or a similar asset) at a fixed price on a future date (REPO or stock lending), the 
arrangement is accounted for as a normal sale transaction and the financial assets should be derecognized in the seller’s book 
and recognised in the buyer’s book.
viii) Financial guarantees
IFRSs: As per IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, financial guarantees are contracts that require an entity to make specified payments 
to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the 
terms of the  instrument. Financial guarantee liabilities are recognized initially at their fair value and is amortized over the life 
of the instrument. Any such liability is subsequently carried at the higher of this amortized amount and the present value of any 
expected payment when a payment under the guarantee becomes probable. Financial guarantees are prescribed to be included 
within other liabilities. 
Bangladesh Bank: As per BRPD circular no. 14 dated 25 June 2003, financial guarantees such as letter of credit (LC) & letter of 
guarantees (LG) should be treated as off-balance sheet items. No liability is recognized for such guarantee except the cash margin. 
However, general provision is maintained against such guarantees complying with BRPD circular no. 06 dated 25 April 2023. 
ix) Cash and cash equivalents

3662.11 Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out and presented in these financial statements have been applied consistently to all the periods by 
group entities except otherwise instructed by Bangladesh Bank as the primary regulator. Significant accounting policies applied 
in these financial statements are presented separately with relevant notes.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries
The financial statements of subsidiaries which are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group have been 
prepared using uniform accounting policies of the Bank (the Parent) for transactions and other events of similar nature unless 
there is any otherwise instruction by regulators. There is no significant restriction on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds 
to the parent in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans and advances.
2.12 Accounting for changes in policy, accounting estimates and errors
As per IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, any material changes in accounting policies or 
corrections of errors be applied retrospectively. In contrast, changes in accounting estimates should be applied prospectively. The 
carrying amount of assets, liabilities, or equity may be changed following a change in accounting estimates in the period of the 
change. The Bank has made following voluntary change in accounting policy from Revaluation Model to Cost Model: 
Voluntary Change in Accounting Policy from Revaluation Model to Cost Model 
Eastern Bank PLC. (EBL) had been applying the revaluation model to measure its land since 2008, with valuations conducted by 
independent valuers. While international financial reporting standards emphasize the use of observable market data (Level 1 and 
Level 2 inputs) for fair value determination, practical constraints have often necessitated reliance on unobservable inputs (Level 
3), introducing subjectivity and judgment in the valuation process.
Additionally, the inclusion of revalued land in the Bank’s fixed asset base has resulted in a breach of the regulatory cap on immovable 
assets, set at 30% of paid up capital as per BRPD circular, thereby restricting business expansion. Given these challenges, the 
Bank has decided to transition from the revaluation model to the cost model under IAS 16 for subsequent measurement of land.
This change, assessed in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, is expected 
to enhance the reliability and relevance of the financial statements by reducing valuation subjectivity and ensuring greater 
consistency. The cost model aligns with the principles of faithful representation and verifiability as outlined in the Conceptual 
Framework for Financial Reporting, providing a more stable and transparent measurement approach.
This voluntary transition from the 'Revaluation Model' to the 'Cost Model' was made with the concurrence of the external auditors 
of the Bank, A. Qasem & Co., Chartered Accountants, as well as another esteemed independent audit firm, Hoda Vasi Chowdhury 
& Co., Chartered Accountants.
The impact of voluntarily changing the accounting policy from the revaluation model to the cost model on the financial statements 
is outlined below:
Particulars2023
Impact
Published Restated
Fixed assets including premises, furnitures, and fixtures     8,517,304,302         5,994,096,987           (2,523,207,315)
Asset revaluation reserve (Land)     2,283,114,684                                 -             (2,283,114,684)
Deferred tax liability on revaluation reserve (Land)         240,092,631                                 -       (240,092,631)
The transition to the cost model is in compliance with IFRS and addresses regulatory concerns, enabling the Bank to manage its 
assets more effectively. The financial statements remain consistent, reliable, and aligned with regulatory expectations due to this 
shift.

segment revenue and profit, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the management committee of 
the Bank. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is relevant in evaluating 
the results of certain segments. 
ix) Risk management and other related matters
Financial institutions are in the business of taking calculative risk and it is important how a Bank decides on its risk appetite. 
EBL firmly believes that robust risk management is the core function that makes its business sustainable. The risk management 
systems of the Bank in place are discussed below:
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to 
the Bank. Board of Directors is the apex body for credit approval of the Bank. However, a part of credit approval authority is sub-delegated 
to the Managing Director and other officers of the Credit Risk Management (CRM) Division. The Board approves credit policies for the 
management for setting procedures, which together has structured the CRM framework of the bank. The Credit Policy Manual (CPM) 
contains the core principles for identifying, measuring, approving and managing credit risk in the bank. The policy covers corporate, 
retail, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) exposures. Policies and procedures together have structured and standardized CRM process 
both in obligor and portfolio level. There is a comprehensive credit appraisal procedure that covers industry/business risk, management 
risk, financial risk, facility structure risk, security risk, environmental risk, reputational risk, and account performance risk.
Management reviews, at least once in a quarter, the credit exposures and portfolio performance of corporate under a clearly set out 
‘early alert’ policy. If early alerts are raised, account plans are then re-evaluated; remedial actions are set, executed and monitored. 
Remedial action includes, but not limited to exposure reduction, security enhancement, exit of relationship or immediate transfer 
to Special Asset Management Division (SAMD).
The Bank follows the criteria for loan classification and provisioning requirement as stipulated in the BRPD Circular no.14/2012, 
BRPD circular no. 03/2019, BRPD circular no. 16/2020, BRPD circular no. 19/2021, BRPD circular no. 14/2022 and subsequent 
BRPD circulars letters as issued by Bangladesh Bank time to time.  The Bank has maintained adequate provision against impaired 
loans following relevant circulars of Bangladesh Bank. Details of which are stated in note 13.5-13.10 to the financial statements.
b) Liquidity risk
The responsibility of managing and controlling the Bank's liquidity lies with the Asset Liability Committee (ALCO), which 
convenes at least once a month. The Asset Liability Management (ALM) desk, as the primary entity responsible for liquidity risk 
management, diligently oversees and regulates liquidity requirements on a daily basis through effective coordination of funding 
activities. In each ALCO meeting, a monthly projection of fund flows is routinely reviewed.
On a monthly basis, ALCO scrutinizes liquidity management by assessing key ratios, maximum cumulative outflow, upcoming 
funding requirements from all business units, and the asset-liability mismatch. The committee also keeps a close eye on the 
concentration of deposits from large institutional depositors, acknowledging its volatile nature. To further enhance liquidity 
oversight, the Bank prepares a structural liquidity profile, a maturity profile of term deposits, cash flow modeling, and a contingency 
funding plan on a monthly basis. These comprehensive analyses are presented and discussed in ALCO meetings to ensure that 
liquidity levels meet the standards acceptable to both the Bank and regulatory authorities.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024369
FINANCIAL REPORTS
c) Market risk
Risk Management Division (RMD) is responsible for overall monitoring, control and reporting of market risk. Treasury mid office 
of RMD is an integral part of market risk management which independently evaluates and monitors treasury department’s 
transaction from risk perspective. Overall risk parameters and exposures of the Bank are monitored by RMD, periodically reported 
to Executive Risk Management Committee (ERMC) and observations are shared with RMC of the Board. Market risk can be 
subdivided into three categories depending on risk factors: i) interest rate risk, ii) foreign exchange risk, and iii) equity price risk.
i) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital of the Bank arising from movement of interest rates. The movement of interest 
rates affects bank’s reported earnings and capital by changing:
  - Net interest income
  - The market value of trading accounts (and other instruments accounted for by market value), and
  - Other interest sensitive income and expenses.
To manage interest rate risk, ALCO regularly monitors various ratios and parameters. The Bank deploys several analysis 
techniques (e.g. rate sensitive gap analysis, duration gap analysis) to measure interest rate risk, its impact on net interest income 
and takes insight about course of actions. 
ii) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk refers to the potential impact on a bank's financial performance or position due to fluctuations in exchange 
rates between currencies. The Bank encounters this risk through its import payments and outward remittances, constituting 
outflows, while receiving foreign currency inflows from export receipts and inward remittances. The mismatch between these 
inflows and outflows on a given day can lead to exchange rate risk, causing the Bank to have a long or short position resulting 
from customer-driven activities.
Additionally, if the Bank sources funding in one currency by converting funds from another, it faces foreign exchange risk. The 
Bank remains cautious in currency conversion and takes hedges against such exposures.
To manage this risk, the Bank calculates Value at Risk (VaR) on its foreign exchange position, arising from customer-driven 
transactions, at a 95% confidence level on a daily basis. The Bank strategically maintains various nostro accounts to facilitate 
operations in different currencies. As of the end of each day, the Bank ensures that its position adheres to the specified limits set 
by the Bangladesh Bank.
iii) Equity price risk
Equity price risk is the risk of losses caused by changes in equity prices. These losses could arise because of changes in the value 
of listed shares held directly by the Bank; changes in the value of listed shares held by a Bank subsidiary; changes in the value of 
listed shares used as collateral for loans and changes in the value of unlisted shares.
Mark-to-Market is the process the Bank applies for maintaining provision against losses arisen from changes in market price 
of securities. As of 31 December 2024, the Bank had a cumulative provision of BDT 1,646.47 million charging its profit and loss 
account over the periods to cover unrealized loss against quoted and unquoted securities. EBL is also computing Equity VaR 
(Value at Risk) on its equity exposure at 95% and 99% confidence level.
d) Operational risk 
Operational risk encompasses potential losses arising from insufficient or failed internal control processes, human errors, 
system failures, or external events. This includes risks such as fraud (by employees, customers, or third parties), natural disasters, 
technological breakdowns, procedural glitches, and unethical behavior.
 
The Risk Management Division (RMD) has enhanced the operational risk framework by integrating both quantitative and 
qualitative metrics, aligning with regulatory standards and the Bank's risk appetite. The division systematically gathers data 
at varying intervals, from monthly to annually, from diverse sources. Utilizing this data, RMD updates the risk matrix, identifies 
critical and high-risk issues, and reports them to the Management Committee (MANCOM), the Executive Risk Management 
Committee (ERMC), and the Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the Board for strategic guidance and implementation of risk 
mitigation strategies.

--- Page 372 ---
370e) Monitoring activities and corrective measures
The Monitoring Department of ICCD ensures a strong risk culture and internal control framework within EBL, addressing 
regulatory and operational risks while supporting sustainable growth. It plays a key role in maintaining compliance, minimizing 
risks, and enhancing operational efficiency, especially in the face of digital transformation.
Key monitoring activities include:
• Management Reviews – Regular reporting to senior management and the audit committee on operational deficiencies and 
risk mitigation.
• Activity Controls – Periodic performance reviews of key departments like Corporate, Retail & SME, Credit Risk, Treasury, and 
Operations.
• Physical Controls – Restricting access to resources through security measures like dual control and periodic checks.
• Compliance with Exposure Limits – Ensuring adherence to risk limits to manage credit risk and maintain a low non-
performing asset ratio.
• Approvals & Authorizations – Implementing approval thresholds to ensure accountability in transactions.
• Verifications & Reconciliations – Regular verification of transactions and reconciliation of records to detect and rectify 
discrepancies.
This structured approach helps EBL mitigate risks, comply with regulations, and maintain financial stability.
f) Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing
EBL performs a series of activities in identifying, assessing, mitigating and monitoring risks related to Money Laundering (ML) 
and Terrorist Financing (TF). Bank has established a control framework for strict compliance with all regulatory directives 
issued from Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit with regard to AML & CFT. For prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist 
Financing, the Bank has revised Central Compliance Committee (CCC) with 14 department/division heads to ensure collective 
participation of different departments in comprehensive AML and CFT program. Under direction of CCC and Chief Anti Money 
Laundering Compliance Officer (CAMLCO), AML Department implements and monitors different AML & CFT programs across 
bank. In addition to nominating Branch Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Officer (BAMLCO) at branches, we have nominated 
Department Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Officer (DAMLCO) at crucial departments to oversee AML/CFT compliance at root 
level. 
EBL has implemented automated transaction monitoring and sanction screening system to corroborate AML/CFT compliance 
program. Currently 1 domestic and 7 international sanction screening lists are incorporated in the system for sanction compliance 
and 60 rules & 58 reports for robust transaction monitoring. To increase awareness among employees, EBL has adopted training 
programs such as need based training, foundation trainings, certification programs etc. for its employees.                                          
In 2024, we have reviewed the Trade Based Money Laundering Policy (hereinafter referred to as “TBML Policy” in short) in line 
with regulatory guidelines including the recent changes in IPO 2021-2024 and made the revised policy up to date. The objective of 
having EBL TBML Policy is to ensure compliance with all relevant regulations and to maintain the highest standards of integrity in 
all trade-related transactions. It has been developed based on Guidelines for Prevention of Trade Based Money Laundering (2019), 
BFIU Circular 26/2020 and other relevant guidelines issued by Bangladesh Bank and BFIU so that EBL does not deliberately 
facilitate trade-based money laundering and report any related suspicious activities to BFIU.
g) Information and communication technology risk
Eastern Bank PLC. (EBL) has set a benchmark in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) security within Bangladesh’s 
banking industry, strictly adhering to the ICT Security Guidelines of Bangladesh Bank. Since achieving PCI DSS certification 
in 2016, EBL has demonstrated unwavering dedication to protecting sensitive information. This commitment has been further 
solidified by its continued PCI DSS compliance, five consecutive years of ISO 27001:2013 certification, and three years of SWIFT 
CSP certification, all validated by external assessments up to 2024. These accolades underscore EBL’s leadership in information 
security management.
EBL’s ICT Division employs robust physical and logical security measures to protect critical infrastructure, including Data Centers 
and Disaster Recovery Sites, from cyber threats. The Bank is also in the process of establishing a state-of-the-art Security 
Operations Center (SOC), highlighting its proactive stance in cybersecurity and its readiness to combat emerging threats.
In terms of logical security, EBL has implemented advanced measures such as access control systems, intrusion detection 
systems, web application firewalls, and email security gateways. Regular security assessments, including internal and external 
vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, ensure that potential threats are promptly identified and mitigated. Additionally, 
the adoption of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution enhances its capacity for real-time threat detection 
and response.

Accounting policy
All investments are initially recognised at cost, including acquisition charges associated with the investment. Investments in 
government treasury securities or Bangladesh Bank Bills categorised as HTM or/and HFT are subsequently measured as per DOS 
circular no. 5 dated 26 May 2008, related clarifications as per DOS circular letter no. 5 dated 28 January 2009 and DOS Circular Letter 
No. 27 dated December 4, 2023. Investments classified as non-government treasury securities are subsequently measured either at 
cost or market value less any recoverable cost. Details are given below:
Investment in Govt.T-Securities/BB Bills- Held to Maturity (HTM)
Investments which are intended to be held till maturity are classified as Held to Maturity (HTM). These are measured at amortised 
cost at each year-end by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition. Premiums are amortised and discounts are 
accredited, using the effective or historical yield. Any increase in value of securities is booked to equity but decrease to profit and 
loss account. Income is recognised to profit and loss account on accrual basis as per BB guideline. 
Investment in Govt.T-Securities/BB Bills- Held for Trading (HFT)
These are investments primarily held for selling or trading. After initial recognition, investments are marked-to-market on weekly 
basis. Any decrease on revaluation of securities is recognised to profit and loss account, but any increase of value of securities is 
booked to revaluation reserve account as per BB DOS circular no. 5 dated 28 January 2009. Income is recognised to profit and loss 
account on accrual basis as per BB guideline.
REPO and Reverse REPO
Transactions of REPO and Reverse REPO are made following DOS circular no. 6 dated 15 July 2010 of BB. In case of REPO of both 
coupon and non-coupon bearing treasury securities, the Bank adjusts the revaluation reserve account for HFT securities and stops 
the weekly revaluation (if the revaluation date falls within the REPO period) of the same security. For interest bearing security, the 
Bank does not accrue interest during REPO period.
Investment in corporate bond, zero coupon bond, perpetual bond, debenture, pref. share etc.
These are investments primarily 'held to maturity' or 'without maturity date'. After initial recognition at cost, investments are 
measured at realizable value at every period end. Any decrease in value of securities is recognized to profit and loss account, but no 
unrealized gain is booked to revaluation reserve account. Income (i.e. interest, profit, gain or dividend) is recognized to profit and 
loss account on accrual basis as per IFRS and Bangladesh Bank guideline.Amount in BDT

7 Loans and advances/investments
Accounting policy
Loans and advances/investments(initial recognition):
Loans and advances of conventional banking and investments of Islamic Banking operation comprise of non-derivative financial 
assets with fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market. These are recognised at gross amount on 
the date when they are originated. The group has not designated any loans and advances upon initial recognition as at fair value 
through profit and loss account or other comprehensive income.
After initial recognition, loans, advances,investment and interest/investment income receivables are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using effective interest/profit margin rate (EIR) over the relevant periods. The amortised cost of a financial asset is 
the amount at which the asset is measured at initial recognition less principal repayments, using EIR method. The EIR is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the instrument but 
not future credit losses) during the expected life of the financial instrument. 
Loans and advances/investments (classification and provisioning):
Classification of loans into substandard/doubtful/bad-loss category and general provision (GP) on unclassified loans (0.25% to 2%), 
certain off balance-sheet exposures (0.5% to 1%); specific provision (SP) on classified loans (5% to 100%) including rescheduled

under Artah Rin Adalat Act-2003, and adequate provision is maintained as per BRPD circular no. 04 dated 18 February 2024. No 
loans and advances/investments are written off partially and without prior approval of the board of directors in compliance with 
the said circular. At each reporting period end, the bank assesses loans and advances/investments to be written off in compliance 
with BB guideline. 
Loans and advances/investments (recovery from written off):
The Bank takes necessary legal measures against default borrowers for recovery against written off loans and advances/investments 
as per relevant BB guidelines and Artha Rin Adalat Act-2003. Legal cost incurred against those borrowers are initially charged to 
the profit and loss account of the bank.

account as earned and on settlement basis. In 2024, the bank made a recovery of BDT 515 million from written off  loans and

7.13 Willful Loan Defaulters
In compliance with Bangladesh Bank’s BRPD Circular No. 06, dated March 12, 2024, titled “Identification & Finalization of Willful 
Defaulters and Measures to be taken against them,” Eastern Bank PLC. (EBL) established a dedicated Unit on April 4, 2024, under 
the supervision of the DMD & Chief Risk Officer (CRO). This Unit is responsible for identifying and reporting willful loan defaulters, 
strictly adhering to the process flow and timeline outlined in the circular.
As of December 31, 2024, the dedicated Unit has identified several borrowers from various business segments who fall under the 
criteria of willful loan defaulters. After conducting proper due diligence and obtaining approval from the bank’s competent authority, 
quarterly reports have been submitted to the Banking Regulation and Policy Department (BRPD) of Bangladesh Bank in the prescribed 
format. Additionally, the necessary reports have been submitted to the Credit Information Bureau (CIB) of Bangladesh Bank.
The bank will proceed with the next course of action as per sections 6(6) and 6(7) of BRPD circular No. 06, dated March 12, 2024, 
subject to Bangladesh Bank’s decision regarding the appeals submitted by the respective willful defaulters.
8 Fixed assets including premises, furniture and fixtures
Accounting policy
Fixed assets (other than lease items)
The group applies IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment for its own assets which are held for current and future use in the business 
and are expected to be used for more than one year.
Recognition and measurement
Fixed assets except land are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss (if any) as per IAS 16. 
The cost of an item of fixed assets is recognised as an asset if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item 
will flow to the entity, and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The cost of an item of fixed assets comprises:
- its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates.
- any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management.
- the initial estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located.
Subsequent costs
Subsequent costs of enhancement of existing assets are recognised as an addition to the asset, only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The costs of 
day-to-day servicing of fixed assets, i.e. repairs and maintenance is charged to profit and loss account as expense when incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged at the rates stated below on all the applicable items of fixed assets on the basis of estimated useful lives 
following the fixed asset policy of the Bank. In all cases depreciation is calculated on the straight line method. Charging depreciation 
commences from the month of acquisition (for full month) and ceases in the month when the assets are disposed. No depreciation 
is charged on capital work in progress until the usage of the assets.Amount in BDT

EASTERN BANK PLC.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024389
FINANCIAL REPORTS
The rates of depreciation and useful lives for current and comparative years are given below:
Assets categoryEstimated useful lives 
(Years)Rate of  depreciation/ 
amortization per annum
Building 40 2.50%
Furniture and fixture 10 10.00%
Machineries and equipment 5 20.00%
Electromechanical equipment 20 5.00%
Digital banking equipment 8 12.50%
Computer and network equipment 5 20.00%
Vehicle 8 12.50%
Software 5 20.00%
Capital work in progress
Costs incurred for software development, licensing and implementation; hardware up-gradation and related other costs incurred 
as capital expenditures are initially recognised as capital work in progress, until the development or implementation work is 
completed and the asset is ready for intended use. This asset is stated at cost and depreciation/amortization of the asset is charged 
from the date of its intended use.
Derecognition of fixed assets
The carrying amount of an item of fixed assets is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from 
its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from derecognition of an item of fixed assets is recorded in profit and loss account when 
the item is derecognised. 
Impairment of PPE
At each reporting date, the bank evaluates whether there are indications that the carrying amount of an asset may exceed its 
recoverable amount. If such indications exist, the bank estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset is considered impaired 
when its carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, which represents the value that can be recovered through its use or 
sale. In such cases, the impairment loss is recognized as an expense in the profit and loss account unless the asset is measured at 
a revalued amount under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment. For revalued assets, impairment losses are treated as a reduction in 
revaluation surplus, as per the standard. For the reporting period, no impairment losses were recognized in the financial statements 
of the Bank, as no such indications were present as of the reporting date.
Intangible assets
Intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. The Group classifies its intangible assets as per 
IAS 38 Intangible Assets which comprises the value of all licensed computer software including core banking software of the Bank, 
cards management software, cheque processing software (i.e. BEFTN), software of subsidiaries and other integrated customised 
software for call center, ATM service, Finance and HR operations i.e. PMS, FAM, ESS etc. 
Recognition, subsequent expenditure and measurement
The Group recognises an intangible asset if it is probable that future economic benefits that are attributable to the assets will flow 
to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets. The Group does not have 
any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Subsequent expenditure on intangible asset of the Group is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits 
embodied in the specific assets to which it relates; otherwise is charged as expense when incurred.
Impairment of Intangible Assets:
According to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, intangible assets with a definite useful life are initially assessed for any indications of 
impairment. If such indications are identified, an impairment test is conducted.
Details of fixed assets are presented in note 8 and Annexure - A of these financial statements.
Leases
As per IFRS 16 Leases, the bank has made recognition, measurement and disclosure in the financial statements both as Lessee and 
Lessor from the date of commencement or 01 January 2019 (date of initial application).  
Right of use assets (RoU)
The Bank recognises Right of Use assets at the date of initial application of IFRS 16. Right of Use assets are measured at cost, 
less any accumulated depreciation, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of ROU assets includes the 
amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct cost incurred, and lease payment made on or before the commencement date 
less any lease incentives received. Right of Use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Right of Use 
assets are presented under fixed assets.

--- Page 392 ---
390Lease Liabilities
At the commencement of the lease, the bank recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be 
made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed and variable lease payment (less any adjustment for initial payment), 
and amount is expected to be paid under guaranteed residual value. The lease payments also include the exercise price of purchase 
option reasonably certain to be exercised by the bank and payment of penalties for terminating the lease. The lease liability is 
measured by adjusting its carrying amount to account for interest accrued on the liability, reducing it for lease payments made, and 
remeasuring it to reflect any reassessment or modifications to the lease. The interest for each period of the lease term is calculated 
to ensure a consistent periodic interest rate is applied to the outstanding balance of the lease liability. The lease payments have 
been discounted using Treasury bond rate of similar tenors i.e. 3 -10 years as implicit borrowing rate on applicable point of time.
For example, 5 years T-bond rate ranging from 8.20% – 10.5% have been used at the time of execution of those contracts having 
weighted average lease tenor of 5 years or more.
Short-term leases and leases of low value assets
EBL assessed all live lease contracts and has chosen not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low value 
assets and short-term leases, i.e. for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application. The Bank recognizes 
lease payments associated with these leases as an expense. For leases of low value items, the Bank has adopted a single threshold on a 
lease-by-lease basis, based on the materiality level outlined in the Fixed Assets Policy. Bank has not recognized RoU assets and liabilities 
for such items (ATM booths, branches, and sub-branches) which values are within materiality levels following paragraph 5 of IFRS 16.
In 2024 the bank reassessed all lease payments of existing contracts for remaining period considering a cut-off date i.e. 01 January 
2024. The lease liabilities are presented in the note 13 of these financial statements.

9.6 Fair value measurement of TREC and Shares of both DSE and CSE (held by EBLSL)
As per Exchange Demutualization Act 2013, EBLSL was awarded Trading Right Entitlement Certificate (TREC) as well as ordinary shares 
of both the bourses i.e. DSE and CSE in exchange of membership licenses under Demutualization Scheme ('the Scheme'). Subsequently, 
under a purchase agreement between demutualized DSE and strategic partner China Consortium, EBLSL sold out 25% of its holding 
to China Consortium at a negotiated  price of BDT 21 per share (Face value: BDT 10 each) and under a purchase agreement between 
demutualized CSE and strategic partner ABG limited, EBLSL sold 25% of its holding to ABG limited at a negotiated  price of BDT 15 per 
share (Face value: BDT 10 each). As of 31-12-2024, share composition of DSE and CSE held by EBLSL was as follows:
Particulars No of shares held Face value per share (BDT)
Dhaka Stock Exchange PLC. (DSE) 5,411,329 10.00
Chittagong Stock Exchange PLC. (CSE) 3,215,497 10.00
8,626,826
Earlier, EBLSL carried out a valuation by ACNABIN, Chartered Accountants, to determine the fair value of TREC and Shares of 
both the bourses i.e. DSE and CSE. The value of TREC was determined applying varying weights to the results of three valuation 
approaches i.e. Cost approach, Market approach and Income approach. Fair value of DSE shares was determined on the basis of 
recent transaction price made between DSE and China Consortium but face value of CSE shares was taken as fair value as there was 
no offer price from any third party. However, EBL management expects the fair value of TREC and Shares of DSE and CSE altogether 
is to be similar to net realizable value in line with present growth pattern of business and outlook of EBLSL. The valuation result of 
TREC and Shares held by EBLSL under the above methodologies are as follows:

Accounting policy
Non-banking asset (NBA) is acquired due to failure of borrower to repay the loan in time taken against mortgaged properties. NBA 
is recognised in the financial statements on the basis of third party valuation and in compliance with the NBA Policy guided by 
Bangladesh Bank (BRPD circular no. 22 dated 20 September 2021). 
As on the reporting date, the Bank has been awarded absolute ownership on few mortgaged properties (mostly land) through the 
verdict of the honorable court under section 33 (7) of the Artharin Adalat Act 2003 but those are yet to be recognized in the financial 
statements as non-earning assets in compliance with the said BB circular. 
Details of NBAs awarded to the Bank are given in Annexure- D1.

13 Other liabilities
Accounting policy
Other liabilities comprise items such as provision for loans and advances/investments, provision for taxes, interest/profit payable on 
borrowing/placement, interest suspense/profit suspense and accrued expenses etc. Individual item-wise liabilities are recognised 
as per the applicable guidelines of Bangladesh Bank and International Financial Reporting Standards.
Provision for current tax expense
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the 
reporting date and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.
Provision for current income tax of the Bank has been made on taxable income @ 37.5 % considering major disallowances of 
expenses and concessional rates on certain incomes (15% on gain from govt. securities, 15% on capital gain of shares & mutual 
funds and 20% on dividend income) as per Income Tax Act 2023. Tax provision of the Group entities is made on taxable income of 
subsidiaries at different rates applicable as per the ITA 2023 and the tax authority of the country where it is incorporated. Details of 
provisioning are stated in note 13.4 of these financial statements.
Assessment for uncertainty over income tax treatments (under IFRIC 23)
At each reporting period, the Bank assesses uncertain tax treatment (if any) separately or together in line with Income Tax Act 
2023 and subsequent Finance Bill 2024. The Bank applies its own judgment and past evidence of tax assessment and demand in 
identifying uncertainties over income tax treatments. Since the Bank is being operated as complex financial intermediary to provide 
comprehensive financial solutions, it assesses whether the interpretation of IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments has 
any impact particularly on those relating to transfer pricing, payment under credit facilities etc., in its consolidated financial 
statements. The Bank believes that its tax treatments (including those for the subsidiaries) is more likely to be accepted by the tax 
authority. Therefore, this interpretation does not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Bank.Amount in BDT

trustee board.
Provident fund

employees (10% of basic salary) and the Bank equally. The Bank’s contribution is made each month and recorded under salary and 
allowances. This fund is managed by a separate trustee board and any investment decision out of this fund is made separately by

--- Page 404 ---
402Defined benefit plans
Post-employment benefit plans which define the amount that outgoing members will receive from the plans on separation on the 
bases of length of service and salary levels.
Contributions are made by the Bank into the scheme based on actuarial valuation. The Bank has an obligation to make up any 
shortfall in the plan, thereby bearing the risk of the plan under performing. The Bank maintains two defined benefit plans i.e. 
gratuity fund and superannuation fund for its employees under two separate trustee boards. Three local subsidiaries (EBLSL, EBLIL 
& EBLAML) also maintain  defined benefit plan i.e. 'Gratuity fund' under separate trustee boards.
Gratuity fund
The Bank operates a funded gratuity scheme recognised by NBR with effect from 1 January 1997. This fund is managed separately 
by a separate trustee board and any investment decision out of this fund is also made by this Board of Trustees. The benefit is paid 
on separation to the eligible employees i.e. who have completed at least 5 (five) years of continuous service. As per the Bank's policy, 
eligible employees are provided with the benefit equal to the latest monthly basic salary multiplied by applicable rates that varies 
as per service length.
Contribution to gratuity fund is made monthly on the basis of actuarial valuation made each year, or immediately after any major 
change in the salary structure that could impact the periodic amount of contributions. The last actuarial valuation was carried 
out on 31 December 2024 by Air Consulting Limited and as per their recommendation the Bank charged BDT 249.8 million to the 
Profit & Loss Account in 2024 as current service cost. The bank also contributed @ 16.50% (BDT 422.1 million) of basic salary to the 
gratuity fund in 2024 as per actuarial recommendation.
Superannuation fund
The Bank operates a recognised superannuation fund effective from 20 November 1999 which is governed by the trust deed of 
'EBL Employees Superannuation Fund Trust'. As per the trust deed, benefit is payable to the eligible employees of the Bank as per 
their grade, length of service etc. As per the last valuation by Air Consulting Limited carried out on 31 December 2024, the Bank 
charged current service cost of BDT 4.0 million to the Profit & Loss Account in 2024. The bank also contributed BDT 24.0 million to 
the superannuation fund in 2024 as per actuarial recommendation.
Details i.e. actuarial liability, valuation method, service cost, required contribution etc. of defined benefit plans and amount 
recognized in profit & loss account are stated in note 13.17of these financial statements.
Workers Profit Participation Fund
Consistent with widely accepted industry practice and in line with section 11(1) of the Bank Company Act 1991 (as amendment up 
to date) and subsequent clarification given by Bank & Financial Institutions Division (BFID), Ministry of Finance, no provision has 
been made by the Bank in the reporting period against Workers Profit Participation Fund (WPPF).
Other long-term benefits
The Bank's obligation in respect of long term benefit other than gratuity fund and superannuation fund is the amount of future 
benefits that employees have earned i.e. earned leave encashment in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The 
nature of this benefit to the eligible employees is encashment of earned leave up to maximum 90 days which is calculated based on 
last basic salary, house rent and medical allowance and is paid at the time of paying end service benefit. The Bank has kept required 
provision against liability for earned leave encashment as per actuarial valuation.
The Group does not have any other long term employee benefit plans.
Short term benefits
Short term employee benefits i.e. hospitalisation facilities are expensed as the related service is provided to the eligible employees 
as per EBL people management policy. Liability is recognised only for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation to pay any amount as a result of past service provided by the employees and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.
Dividend payments
Interim dividend is recognised only when the shareholders' right to receive payment is established. Final dividend is recognised 
when it is approved by the shareholders in AGM. However, the proposed dividend for the year 2024 has not been recognised 
as a liability in the balance sheet in accordance with IAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period. Dividend payable to the Bank’s 
shareholders is recognised as a liability and deducted from the shareholders’ equity in the period in which the shareholders’ right 
to receive payment is established.

Net defined benefit obligation is the net result of post employment benefit plans which is measured as per actuarial valuation under 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits. Valuation is carried out on 'Projected unit credit method' as recommended by International Accounting 
Standard (IAS) 19. Under this method, the valuation is done considering both 'future service cost' which an employee shall obtain in 
normal course of service and 'past service cost' which is the difference between assets built up from past contributions and accrued 
liabilities (i.e. benefits earned by members as a result of service as of valuation date).

salary growth rate, mortality rate, probable length of service etc.
The amount of obligation for superannuation fund is determined on the occurence of certain pre-defined events which is related 
with employee rank (not salary) and certain threshold level of service being reached i.e. survival or withdrawal probabilities.Amount in BDT

14.2 Capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR)
As per the 'Revised Guidelines on Risk Based Capital Adequacy (RBCA)’ issued by Bangladesh Bank in December 2014, all scheduled 
banks are required to calculate Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio based on ‘Solo’ as well as ‘Consolidated’ basis since early 2015. 
Here, regulatory capital base is quite different from accounting capital. Regulatory capital consists of Tier-1 (Common Equity Tier 1 
and Additional Tier 1) and Tier 2 capital. Assessing regulatory capital in relation to overall risk exposures of a bank is an integrated 
and comprehensive process. EBL has been generating most of its incremental capital from retained profit (stock dividend and 
statutory reserve transfer etc.) and occasional issue of subordinated debt and right shares to support incremental growth of Risk 
Weighted Assets (RWA). Besides regulatory capital requirement, the Bank maintains surplus capital which will act as buffer for 
absorbing all material risks and to support foreseen business growth activities.

the amount reported as Tier 2 capital (2024: BDT 4,630 Million; 2023: BDT 6,020 Million) due to amortizing 20% of the subscribed

Based Capital Adequacy.
15 Statutory Reserve
In compliance with the provision of section 24 of the Bank Company Act 1991 (as amended up to date), the Bank is to transfer at least 
20% of its profit before tax (PBT) to statutory reserve each year until the sum of statutory reserve and share premium (if any) equal 
the paid-up capital of the Bank. In 2024, the bank has transferred BDT 1,509.04 million to statutory reserve account in compliance 
with the said provision.

16 Dividend equalization reserve
As per BRPD Circular No. 18 dated 20 October 2002, Banks had to transfer an equal amount of net profit (amount by which cash 
dividend exceeds 20%) to Dividend Equalization Account while paying cash dividend in excess of 20%. This is treated as 'Core 
Capital' of the Bank.
However, bank's current dividend decision is made in compliance with DOS Circular no. 01 dated 07 February 2021 wherein banks' 
dividend payment capacity is tagged and capped in relation to CRAR of the respective banks. Amount in BDT

mutual funds is recognised in profit and loss account at the time of effecting the transactions except those which are restricted by

Though the issuer of the perpetual bonds has a right to cancel any coupon payments to bondholders on a condition of non-payment 
of dividend to equity holders, the track record of our investee entities in terms of consistent dividend payments backed by good 
asset quality, strong capital base, good profitability and efficient liquidity management does not necessitate us to expect that they 
will cancel the coupon payments. Therefore, during the year, the bank recognized dividend income of BDT 63,155,033.71 on accrual 
basis.
25 Commission, exchange and brokerage
Recognition policy:
Fees and commission income arising from services provided by the Bank are recognised as income on accrual basis as per IFRS 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Fees and commission charged to customers on trade finance i.e. L/C, L/G, acceptance and 
other general banking services i.e. card services, management fees, arrangement fees, locker charges etc. are recognised as income 
when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised service to customer by the bank, and at the time of effecting 
the transactions except those which are received in advance.
Exchange gain includes all gains and losses from foreign currency day-to-day transactions, conversions and revaluation of non

27.1 Current service cost - Gratuity Fund (Bank only)
The current service costs of the defined benefit plans are determined as per the actuarial valuation report which involves making 
assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates, future pension 
increase, etc. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty, hence the bank 
carries actuarial valuation each year. 
The last valuation was carried out on 31 December 2024 by Air Consulting Limited and as per their recommendation the Bank 
charged BDT 249.80  million to the Profit & Loss Account in 2024 as current service cost. The bank also continued to contribute 
16.50% of basic salary to the Gratuity Fund in 2024 as per actuarial recommendation.
27.2 Current service cost - Superannuation Fund (Bank only)
Contribution to superannuation fund is made as per actuarial valuation of the fund. Valuation is carried out on 'Projected unit credit 
method' as per International Accounting Standard (IAS) 19 Employee Benefits to determine the present value of obligations and the 
related current service cost and, where applicable past service cost. The amount of obligation is determined on the occurence of 
certain pre-defined events which is related with employee rank (not salary) and certain threshold level of service being reached i.e. 
survival or withdrawal probabilities.
As per the the latest valuation by Air Consulting Limited carried out on 31 December 2024, the Bank charged current service cost of 
BDT 4.00 million to the Profit & Loss Account in 2024. The bank also contributes BDT 24.00 million to the Superannuation Fund in 
2024 as per actuarial recommendation.

Discontinuation of transactions with “related parties”: Following Bangladesh Bank BRPD circular -12 dated 15 June 2022 (restricting banks 
from procuring goods or services from “related parties”), EBL discontinued procuring goods and services (i.e. courier, internet, refreshment 
items etc.) from respective related party entities except Unique Hotel & Resorts PLC and replaced all those by suitable alternatives by the 
end of 2022. However, EBL Skylounge situated at HSIA, Dhaka of which service is taken from Unique Hotel & Resorts PLC (UHRL) is yet to 
be replaced due to its unique nature of propositions and absence of ready and suitable alternatives. Considering the business sensitivity 
(especially cards business) and unavailability of suitable alternative for replacing UHRL, EBL applied and got permission from Bangladesh 
Bank to continue with the UHRL till 30th June 2025 (Ref. BRPD letter no. LS-2/745(19)/2024-7536 dated 29th August, 2024).

 1.0  Status of EBL Islamic Banking 
Islamic Banking, the more general term is expected not only to avoid interest-based transactions prohibited by the Islamic Shariah, 
but also to avoid unethical practices and actively participate in achieving the goals and objectives of an Islamic economy. EBL 
Islamic Banking has started Islamic Banking operations since August 22, 2024 with a view to conducting businesses complying 
Shariah. We have developed products based on the Shariah principles and Bangladesh Bank guidelines to cater to the needs of 
different segments of customers. The operation of our Islamic Banking is totally different from the Bank's conventional operation 
as the former operates their business on the basis of Islamic Shariah. However, Accounting system is vital for ensuring Shariah 
compliance. Hence, EBL Islamic Banking is committed to following the accounting principles that refrain from interest.
1.1 Nature of Business
The Islamic Banking Unit of EBL offers all kinds of Islamic Shariah based commercial Banking services to its customers through its 
windows following the provisions of the Bank Company Act 1991 (as amended), Bangladesh Bank’s Directives and directives of other 
regulatory authorities and the principles of the Islamic Shariah.
Our offerings include: Deposits products-Islamic Current Account based on Al-Wadiah principle and Islamic Savings, Islamic SND, 
Islamic RD & Islamic Term Deposits based on Mudaraba Principle and Financing Products based on shariah mode-Murabahah, 
Diminishing Musharakah, Continuous Musharakah etc. EBL Islamic Banking Operations are closely monitored and supervised by a 
knowledgeable & committed team in Islamic Banking to ensure compliance, development and growth of Islamic Banking Business.
1.2 Profit Distribution Framework for depositors of EBL Islamic Banking
Considering the Shariah issues as well as Guidelines for Islamic Banking issued by Bangladesh Bank, EBL has prepared ‘Weightage based 
Framework of Rate of Return’ for distributing profit among the depositors. This Framework focuses on technique of ‘Distribution of Income’ 
to the Mudarabah based depositors of the Bank. As per framework, EBL Islamic Banking offers product wise PSR (Bank: Customers) and 
weightage to all types of Mudarabah deposits. For the year ended 31 December 2024, 70% of total distributable income is allocated to 
the different types of Mudaraba depositors. And, the remaining 30% of the distributable income is retained by the Bank. The weightage 
represents the importance attached to the holding of each deposit in determination of profit. The weightage and any subsequent change 
in weightage of Mudarabah deposits has been disclosed to Mudarabah depositors at the time of Mudarabah contract. Initially, Provisional 
profit rate is applied to the different types of deposit accounts at the rates decided by the Bank from time to time taking into consideration 
of the industry trend. Final rates of profit are declared annually after the end of the year on the basis of income earned from different 
investments and other businesses and distributed as per weightage of the different deposit products.
2.0 Basis of preparation of the Financial Statements
"Islamic Banking Unit” of the Bank is being operated in strict compliance with the rules of Islamic Shariah. The financial statements 
of the unit have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and as per provisions of the “Guidelines for Islamic Banking” issued by Bangladesh Bank through BRPD Circular No. 15 dated 
09 November 2009 with reference to the provisions of the Bank Company Act, 1991 (as amended) and other circulars/ instructions 
of Bangladesh Bank, the Companies Act 1994, the Securities and Exchange Rules 2020 , keeping in view of the Standards issued by 
the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI).

with those of IFRSs as adopted, the requirements of the Bank Company Act, 1991 (as amended) and provisions and circulars issued 
by Bangladesh Bank shall prevail. 
2.1 Income/ Revenue Recognition Principle
Considering the Shariah issues as well as Guidelines for Islamic Banking issued by Bangladesh Bank, EBL has prepared ‘Weightage 
based Framework of Rate of Return’ for distributing profit among the depositors. This Framework focuses on technique of 
‘Distribution of Income’ to the Mudarabah based depositors of the Bank. As per framework, EBL Islamic Banking offers product 
wise PSR (Bank: Customers) and weightage to all types of Mudarabah deposits. For the year ended 31 December 2024, 70% of total 
distributable income is allocated to the different types of Mudaraba depositors. And, the remaining 30% of the distributable income 
is retained by the Bank. The weightage represents the importance attached to the holding of each deposit in determination of profit. 
The weightage and any subsequent change in weightage of Mudarabah deposits has been disclosed to Mudarabah depositors at the 
time of Mudarabah contract. Initially, Provisional profit rate is applied to the different types of deposit accounts at the rates decided 
by the Bank from time to time taking into consideration of the industry trend. Final rates of profit are declared annually after the end 
of the year on the basis of income earned from different investments and other businesses and distributed as per weightage of the 
different deposit products.Eastern Bank PLC.

Notes to the Financial Statements
As at and the period from 22 August 2024 to 31 December 2024

--- Page 458 ---
456As per Shariah, depositors share profit from funded income such as investment income, income from investment in shares/
securities, exchange gain etc. During the year, total income is less than amount distributed as profit paid on deposit. As per Shariah 
the excess amount is required to be adjusted, considering the market trends. The issue was placed to the meeting of EBL SSC and the 
committee resolved that the excess amount paid to the depositors compared to final share amount will be regarded as gift/hadiah 
from EBL Islamic banking and the excess amount paid to be adjusted against the income of EBL Islamic banking in the year 2025. 
Recognition of income from investment follows principles as under: 
2.2 Expense Recognition Principle 
Expense in respect of profit paid on deposit is recognized on accrual basis. Monthly accruals in this respect are calculated on the 
basis of Provisional Profit Rate. Final rates of profit are declared annually after the end of the year on the basis of income earned from 
different investments and other businesses and distributed as per PSR & weightage of the different deposit products. 
2.3 Compensation Account & Shariah Non-Compliance Income
Income if becomes doubtful as per Shariah should not be included in the distributable income of the Bank. Compensation is not also 
permissible as regular income of the Bank as per Shariah. Both of the income, if accrued, will go for charity.
2.4 Reporting Period

FINANCIAL REPORTS
Financial Statements of the Subsidiaries  
Directors’ report to the shareholders of EBL Securities PLC. (EBLSL)
The Board of Directors of EBL Securities PLC. (EBLSL) takes 
pleasure in presenting the Directors’ Report on the Company’s 
operational and financial activities, along with the audited financial 
statements for the year ended on December 31, 2024 for your kind 
consideration. 
Market scenario in 2024
The year 2024 marked a significant impact on Bangladesh’s capital 
market, influenced by political transitions and regulatory changes. 
Investor sentiment mostly remained cautious due to economic and 
political uncertainties, resulting in the Dhaka Stock Exchange’s 
(DSEX) broad index plunging by 1,030 points (16.5%) to close at 
5,216 points, while intra-year index value declined to further low 
at 4,899 points. Meanwhile, the daily average turnover in DSE 
remained modest at BDT 6.3 billion, reflecting the market’s overall 
stagnation in trading activities. 
The year started out with national election-centric uncertainties, 
while BSEC’s withdrawal of floor prices from the majority of scrips 
after around 1.5 years triggered an immediate market volatility. 
Although experiencing a brief recovery, a prolonged downtrend 
ensued until the national budget declaration in June, exacerbated 
by NBR’s proposal to impose taxes on capital gains, alongside an 
elevated interest rate regime amidst the central bank’s continued 
monetary tightening measures. Moreover, gradual uplifting of floor 
price from the remaining large-cap stocks added further pressure to the ailing market, despite revising the lower circuit breaker to 
3% to ease the market’s free fall. However, the market somewhat 
recovered from that relentless bearish spell as opportunistic 
investors opted to capitalize on the oversold issues.
Investor sentiment observed another blow due to civil unrest 
centering on student movement in July, impeding the market’s 
recovery. Nevertheless, the market experienced an investor 
euphoria following the change in regime with heightened market 
participation driven by overall market optimism. Nonetheless, the 
momentum failed to sustain for long since the heated-up market 
induced caution among investors due to the apparent economic 
and political challenges, while the central bank’s board reformation 
attempts for particular struggling banks also triggered further 
caution regarding the market’s trend. 
The stock market regulator, BSEC, took several initiatives under 
the new leadership, including reinstating regular circuit breaker 
policies and forming a probe committee to address various 
market irregularities, aimed to promote an interference-free and 
fair-trading environment. However, despite forming a task force 
for capital market reforms and the central bank’s approval of the 
anticipated BDT 30 billion sovereign-guaranteed loan to ICB, the 
market remained subdued.
In summary, Bangladesh’s capital market in 2024 navigated a 
challenging environment marked by political transitions, regulatory 
shifts and persistent economic uncertainties.

462Financial highlights
The year 2024 posed significant challenges for the capital market 
stakeholders and intermediaries due to a prolonged market 
downturn. EBL Securities PLC. (EBLSL) also navigated through a 
difficult period due to the overall stagnation in trading activities.
Despite all the challenges, EBLSL demonstrated resilience, 
maintaining its top ten position during the year while achieving 
a total operating income of BDT 98.48 million. However, due to 
adverse market conditions, EBLSL was required to maintain 
higher provisioning against its capital market investments and 
margin loans, which eventually led to a negative bottom line for the 
company with a net loss of BDT 818.19 million for the year. 
Nevertheless, the company remains steadfast in its commitment 
to overcoming these challenges and looks forward to bringing in 
some strategic and qualitative developments and minimizing 
its risk exposure to ensure resilience during such future market 
contingencies, fostering sustainable and steady growth while 
adhering to the stringent compliance standards. 
Dividend
EBLSL has maintained a strong track record of dividend 
disbursement, with dividend payout exceeding 70% in the prior 
three years, which was one of the highest among its peers. However, 
no dividend has been declared for the year 2024 amidst the apparent 
financial challenges arising from unfavorable market conditions. 
Moving forward, EBLSL may focus on retaining and reinvesting 
earnings to strengthen the company’s balance sheet in adherence 
to a sustainable growth strategy.
Awards & achievements
EBL Securities PLC. has been honored with the “Best Stock 
Brokerage House” award from Bangladesh in the Annual Global 
Economics Awards Program 2024 in recognition of its commitment 
and dedication in providing brokerage services to its valued 
clients and its contribution to the development and progress of the 
country’s capital market.
Way forward
• Ensuring effective monitoring of Margin Loan and proper 
management of Negative Equity
• Arranging low-cost funds to reduce finance costs and 
strengthen the company’s financial position for facilitating the 
growth of the company
• Implementing Order Management System (OMS) to ensure 
better compliance, efficient trade operation and seamless 
integration of back-office & front-office operations

services to clients to ensure maximum customer satisfaction

programs, and encouraging job rotation within the organization

parent i.e. Eastern Bank PLC. and sister concerns to maximize 
offline and online customer outreach• Maximizing synergy for EBL family through exploring mutual 
business opportunities
Market outlook for 2025
The capital market is expected to remain cautious in 2025 amidst 
the backdrop of ongoing political and economic uncertainties. The 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently lowered the economic 
growth forecast for Bangladesh to 3.8% for FY’25, which also 
closely aligns with the World Bank’s projection of 4.1% GDP growth. 
However, recent easing of adversities on the macroeconomic front—
such as growing exports, rising remittances, stabilized foreign 
exchange reserves and potential foreign funding inflows—offers 
some hope for a potential economic recovery. 
Bangladesh Bank has been prioritizing controlling inflation in its 
monetary policy stance, with continuous policy rate hikes, as it aims 
to bring down inflation by mid-2025. However, challenges may arise 
in achieving this goal due to potential inflationary shocks from 
recent tax hikes on certain products and services, along with further 
depreciation of the local currency (BDT) due to moving towards 
greater exchange rate flexibility in line with the central bank’s 
foreign exchange intervention strategy. Hence, higher interest rate 
environment is likely to pose challenges in recovering from the 
stagnancy in capital market. 
However, political uncertainties are expected to lessen in the 
latter half of the year, depending on clarity surrounding the next 
parliamentary elections. Additionally, global fund manager Asia 
Frontier Capital (AFC) also projects a modest revival in Bangladesh’s 
stock market in H2 of 2025.
Currently, Bangladesh’s capital market stands at an attractive 
valuation level, indicating a potentially lucrative investment 
avenue. Upon adequate money flows following the easing of current 
adversities, the market is well-positioned for a recovery from its 
gloomy phase. Unlike 2024, companies with sound fundamentals 
and good governance from Banks/Financial Institutions, FMCG, 
Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals and Food & Allied sector are expected 
to remain resilient in 2025, while companies from Engineering, 
Construction, Fuel & Power and Textiles may remain subdued. 
Hence, investors should keep an eye on the potential sectors and 
companies with strong fundamentals, as they may offer promising 
investment opportunities in the coming year.
Credit rating
The company has been rated A+ (A Plus) in the long term and ST-2 
in the short term in the latest credit rating report by Emerging 
Credit Rating Limited.
Appointment of auditors
As per section 210 of the Companies Act 1994, the company’s 
statutory auditors, MABS & J Partners, will retire at the 28th AGM 
of the company. They carried out the audit for the year ended 
31.12.2024 and submitted their report in time. They have done their 
job properly. The Board has also recommended appointing MABS & 
J Partners as the auditor of the company for the year 2025.

464Independent Auditor’s Report   
To the shareholders of EBL Securities PLC.
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of EBL Securities PLC., which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2024, 
and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year 
then ended 2024, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at 
31 December 2024, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and other applicable laws and regulations.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company 
in accordance with the International Ethics Standard Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and 
we have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA code and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh 
(ICAB) Bye Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements
Management of EBL Securities PLC. is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance 
with IFRSs, the Companies Act 1994, the Securities and Exchange Rules 2020 and other applicable laws and regulations and such internal 
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made 
by management.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024465
FINANCIAL REPORTS
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company 
to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, to communicate with them all relationship and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
In accordance with the Companies Act 1994 and Securities and Exchange Rules 2020, We also report the following:
a) we have obtained all the information and explanation which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose of 
our audit and made due verification thereof;
b) in our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as it appeared from our examination 
of those books;
c) the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income dealt with by the report are in 
agreement with the books of account; and
d) the expenditure w as incurred for the purpose of the company’s business.

at the transaction price.

3.13 Application of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 16
Leases
IFRS 16 Leases has come into force on 1 January 2019, as adopted by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). EBL Securities PLC. 
applied IFRS 16 and measured the lease liability at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted it using the 
bank’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application, and recognized a right-of-use asset at the date of the initial 
application on a lease by lease. 
Right-of-use assets (Rou):
EBL Securities PLC. recognizes right-of-use assets at the date of initial application of IFRS 16. Right-of-use assets are measured 
at cost, less any accumulated depreciation, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The right-of-use assets are presented under non-current assets. 
Lease liabilities:
At the commencement date of the lease, EBL Securities PLC. recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease 
payments to be made over the lease term using incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. Lease liability is 
measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect 
the lease payments, and re-measuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications. Interest on the 
lease liability in each period during the lease term shall be the amount that produces a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the lease liability.
Short-term leases and leases of low value assets:
EBL Securities PLC. has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low value assets and short-
term leases, i.e. for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application. The Company recognizes lease 
payments associated with these leases as an expense.

for any loss arising from diminution in value of investment in light with BSEC ref  # BSEC/SRI/NE/2020/333 dated 27 March, 2023. 
However, required provisions have been made for any loss arising from diminution in value of investment.

--- Page 476 ---
4743.15 Earnings per share (EPS)
This has been calculated by dividing the profit after tax (PAT) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding as 
on 31 December 2024 as per IAS-33 Earnings Per Share. Diluted earnings per share is not required to be calculated for the year, as 
there exists no dilution possibilities during the year.
3.16 Statement of Cash Flows
The financial statements are prepared following the accrual basis of accounting except statement of cash flows. Statement of 
Cash flows is prepared following cash basis of accounting and in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 7 
Statement of Cash Flows.
3.17 Events after the reporting period
All material events after the reporting period have been considered and appropriate adjustments/disclosures have been made in 
the financial statements as per IAS 10 Events after the reporting period.
3.18 Departure from IFRS:
IFRS 9-Financial Instruments describes the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities. A 
financial asset is measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) unless it is measured at amortized cost or at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Classification depends on both the company’s business model for managing the 
financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Regardless above, the company recognizes 
and presents its financial instruments at cost and maintains required provision considering the directive ref # BSEC/SRI/
NE/2020/333 dated 27 March 2023, BSEC/SRI/NE/2020/605 dated 28 December 2022, BSEC/CMRRCD/2009-193/203 dated 28 
December 2017 and SEC/CMRRCD/2009-193/196 dated 28 December 2016 as issued by Bangladesh Securities and Exchange 
Commission (BSEC). In addition to that, the company also follows the Dhaka Stock Exchange PLC.’s Guidelines ref # DSE/COM/
TAD/CLR/AFS_2022/647 dated 13 March 2023 where it also gives the options for recognition and presentation of financial 
instruments at cost and maintaining required provision complying BSEC directives.

484Directors’ Report of EBL Investments Limited (EBLIL) 
The Board of Directors of EBL Investments Limited (EBLIL) is pleased to present the Directors’ Report on the operational and financial 
activities of EBLIL together with the Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 for your valued consideration, 
approval and adoption which has been prepared in compliance with section 184 of the Companies Act, 1994 and the requirements mandated 
by the regulatory bodies. 
EBL Investments Limited
EBL Investments Limited (EBLIL) is a fully owned subsidiary of Eastern Bank PLC. (EBL). It has obtained license from Bangladesh Securities 
& Exchange Commission (BSEC) as full- fledged Merchant Bank in 2013. Paid-up Capital of EBLIL is BDT 680 million. EBLIL provides a full 
range of investment banking facilities including conventional merchant banking activities. EBLIL also focuses on originating, structuring, 
underwriting and executing debt financing including syndications, corporate bonds, and other debt linked products.
Capital Market Outlook
In 2024, the capital market of the country experienced an eventful year, due to a notable shift in the political situation, followed by a change in 
the stock market leadership. At the beginning of the year, Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC)’s decision of withdrawal of 
floor price from the majority of scrips led to significant market volatility. Despite a minor recovery in the market, the proposal to impose taxes 
on capital gains by National Board of Revenue (NBR) and the monetary tightening measures implemented by Bangladesh Bank triggered a 
downward trend in the market. After a change in the political regime, the market experienced a brief surge from increased participation but 
this momentum slowed as investors became cautious amid ongoing economic and political challenges. BSEC also implemented regulatory 
changes by forming a taskforce to reform capital market aimed at addressing various issues and enhancing market transparency and 
efficiency.
It is expected that the capital market might go through a challenging landscape in 2025. However, easing the adversities from macroeconomic 
conditions such as rising remittances, stable foreign exchange reserves, foreign funding inflows, and political stability might improve the 
condition of the capital market.

Independent Auditor’s Report   
To the Shareholders of EBL Investments Limited
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of EBL Investments Limited, which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 
2024, and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for 
the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at 
31 December 2024, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and other applicable laws and regulations.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in 
accordance with the International Ethics Standard Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and we 
have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA code and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) 
Bye Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements
Management of EBL Investments Limited is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance 
with IFRSs, the Companies Act 1994, the Securities and Exchange Rules 2020 and other application laws and regulations and such internal 
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. 
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made 
by management.

EASTERN BANK PLC.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024487
FINANCIAL REPORTS
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report 
to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company 
to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, to communicate with them all relationship and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
In accordance with the Companies Act 1994 and Securities and Exchange Rules 2020, We also report the following:
a) we have obtained all the information and explanation which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose of 
our audit and made due verification thereof;
b) in our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as it appeared from our examination 
of those books;
c) the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income dealt with by the report are in 
agreement with the books of account; and
d) the expenditure was incurred for the purpose of the company’s business.

4. Financial risk management
4.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations and arises principally from the Company's loans and advances to customers and investment securities. 
These loans and advances are fully backed by the securities held by the customer. 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Company, the maximum exposure is equal to the carrying 
amounts of the financial assets.
4.2 Market risk
The Company's activities may give rise to risk at the time of settlement of transactions and trades. Market risk is the risk of losses 
due to failure of entity to honor its obligations to deliver cash, securities or other assets as contractually agreed.
For such transactions the Company only allows the purchase of tradable securities if the customer has adequate cash/purchase 
power beforehand.
4.3 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The company's 
approach to managing liquidity (cash and cash equivalents) is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient 
liquidity to meet its liabilities under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or damage 
to the company's reputation. Typically, the company ensures that it has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet expected 
operational expenses, including financial obligations through preparation of the cash flow forecast based on time line of payment 
of the financial obligation and accordingly, arrange for sufficient liquidity/ fund to make the expected payment within due date.
This note presents information about the Company's exposure to each of the above risks, the Company's objectives, policies and 
resources for measuring and managing risk, and the Company's management of capital. The Board of Directors (BOD) has overall 
responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company's risk management framework.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024505
FINANCIAL REPORTS
Independent auditor’s report  
to the members of EBL Finance (HK) Limited 
(incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability)
Opinion 
We have audited the financial statements of EBL Finance (HK) 
Limited  (“the Company”) set out on pages 6 to 22, which comprise 
the statement of financial  position as at 31 December 2024, and 
the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes of 
in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then  ended, and 
notes to the financial statements, including material accounting 
policy information. 
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view 
of the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2024, 
and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year 
then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting 
Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly 
prepared in compliance with the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance 
(“HKCO”). 
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Hong Kong Standards 
on Auditing (“HKSAs”)  issued by the HKICPA. Our  responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section 
of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance 
with the HKICPA’s Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“the 
Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The 
other information obtained at the date of this auditor's report is 
information  included in the directors’ report, but does not include 
the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion  thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our  knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.Responsibilities of directors and those charged with 
governance for the financial statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation of financial 
statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs 
issued by the HKICPA and the HKCO, and for such internal control 
as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial  statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either  intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the  
Company's financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and  to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Our responsibility to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our 
audit is solely to you, as a body, in accordance with section 405 of the 
HKCO, and for no other purpose. We do not assume  responsibility 
towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of 
this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements  can arise  from fraud or error  and are considered 
material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these financial statements.
A further  description  of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located at the HKICPA’s website at: http://

Notes to the financial statements 
as at and for the year ended 31 December 2024
1 Organisation and operations
The Company is a private company incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability. The address of its registered office is Unit 1201, 
12th Floor, Albion Plaza, 2-6 Granville Road, Tsimshatsui, Hong Kong.
The principal activity of the Company is engaged in money lending business.
2 Application of new and revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards 
("HKFRSs"), accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong and the requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.
In the current year, the Company has applied for the first time a number of new standards, amendments and interpretations ("new 
HKFRSs") issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("HKICPA"), which are effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2024 with the exception as stated in the following paragraph. The adoption of the new HKFRSs had 
no material effect on how the results and financial position for the current or prior accounting periods have been prepared and 
presented. Accordingly, no prior period adjustment has been required.
The Company has not early applied the following new standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued and 
relevant to the Company but are not yet effective. The directors of the Company anticipate that the application of these standards, 
amendments or interpretations will have no material impact on the results and the financial position of the Company.

2 Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026.
3 Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027.
3 Material accounting policies
(a) Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the HKICPA. 
In addition, the financial statements include applicable disclosures required by the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.
(b) Basis of preparation of financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the financial assets at fair value 
through other comprehensive income, financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The financial statements have also been prepared under the accrual basis of accounting.
(c) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives and 
after taking into account of their estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. Assets held under finance leases are 
depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. The principal annual rates are as 
follows:-
Property leased for own use Over the unexpired lease term
Machineries and equipments 20% - 33.33%
Furniture and fixtures 20%

--- Page 511 ---
EASTERN BANK PLC.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024509
FINANCIAL REPORTS
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the assets (calculated as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the statement of comprehensive income in the year 
in which the item is derecognised.
(d) Leased assets
At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if 
the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control 
is conveyed where the customer has both the right to direct the use of the identified asset and to obtain substantially all of the 
economic benefits from that use.
At the lease commencement date, the Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, except for short-term leases 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. When the Company enters into a lease in respect of a 
low-value asset, the Company decides whether to capitalise the lease on a lease-by-lease basis. The lease payments associated with 
those leases which are not capitalised are recognised as an expense on a systematic basis over the lease term.
Where the lease is capitalised, the lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the lease payments payable over the 
lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, using a relevant 
incremental borrowing rate.
After initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost and interest expense is calculated using the effective 
interest method. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease 
liability and hence are charged to profit or loss in the accounting period in which they are incurred.
The right-of-use asset recognised when a lease is capitalised is initially measured at cost. The right-of-use asset is subsequently 
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
(e) Financial instruments
Classification of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets are categorised into three principal classification categories: measured at amortised cost, at fair value through 
other comprehensive income ("FVOCI") and at fair value through profit or loss ("FVPL"), The classification of financial assets is based 
on the business model under which the financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics.
Financial liabilities are categorised into two principal classification categories: measured at amortised cost, and at fair value 
through profit or loss ('FVPL").
(f) Credit losses and impairment of assets
(i) Credit losses
The Company recognised a loss allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs") on the financial assets measured at amortised 
cost (including cash and cash equivalents, bills and other receivables and deposits).
Measurement of ECLs
ECLs are probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all expected cash 
shortfalls (ie. the difference between the cash flows due to the company in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that 
the company expects to receive).
The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the company is 
exposed to credit risk.
ECLs are remeasured at each reporting date to reflect changes in the financial instrument's credit risk since initial recognition. 
Any change in the ECL amount is recognised as an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss. The Company recognises an 
impairment gain or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a 
loss allowance account, except for investments in debt securities that are measured at FVOCI (recycling), for which the loss 
allowance is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the fair value reserve (recycling).
(ii) Impairment of other non-current assets
At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated 
to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss 
is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, in such a way that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

--- Page 512 ---
510(g) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and on hand, short-term deposits held at banks, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less.
(h) Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of 
reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous year.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax base used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will 
be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except when it relates to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or 
charged directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity 
respectively.
(i) Bills financed and interest receivables
Bills financed and interest receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of bills financed and interest receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original 
terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognised in profit or loss.
(j) Other payables
Other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently stated at amortised cost. The difference between the proceeds 
and the amount payable is recognised over the period of the payable using the effective interest method.
(k) Foreign currencies
(i)Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Company's financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates (the "functional currency"). These financial statements are presented in Hong Kong dollar, which is the 
Company's functional and presentation currency.
(ii) Transactions, assets and liabilities
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the approximate rates ruling on the dates of the transactions. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the approximate rates ruling at the end of reporting 
period. Exchange gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss.
(l) Employee retirement benefits
Costs of employee retirement benefits are recognised as an expense in the year in which they are incurred.
(m) Related parties
Two parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise 
significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also considered to be related if 
they are subject to common control or common significant influence.
(n) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when it is possible that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and when the revenue can be 
measured reliably on the following bases:-
(i) Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis. 
(ii) Fees, commission and charges on letter of credit are recognised when the services are rendered.

16Financial risk management
The Company is exposed to various kinds of risks in its operation and financial instruments. The Company's risk management 
objectives and policies mainly focus on minimising the potential adverse effects of these risks on the Company by closely monitoring 
the individual exposure as follows:-
(a) Market risk
(i) Currency risk
(1) The Company receives its interest income and service fee and pays loan from holding company and interest expenses, mainly 
in US dollar, that exposes it to foreign currency risk arising from such purchases and sales and the resulting payables and 
receivables. The Company closely and continuously monitors the exposure as follows:-
Since HK dollar is pegged to US dollar, there is no significant exposure expected on US dollar transactions and balances.
(2) Sensitivity analysis
As the net exposure of the Company to foreign currency is relatively small, change in foreign currency exchange rate will have no 
material impact on the financial performance of the Company.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Company's exposure to interest rate risk is mainly on its interest-bearing borrowings. In order to manage the interest rate risk, 
the Company will repay the corresponding borrowings when it has surplus funds.
(iii) Price risk
There is no significant price risk as the Company does not have any investment traded in an active market.
(b) Credit risk
The major exposure to credit risk of the Company's financial assets, which comprise bills financed, interest receivables, deposits 
and prepayments, and bank balances, arises from the default of the counterparties, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying 
amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Company's exposure to the risk of liquidity is minimal, as the shareholders of the Company finance sufficient funds to meet the 
Company's continuous operation need.
The maturity profile of all financial liabilities of the Company as at the end of the reporting period, based on the contracted undiscounted 
payments, was as follows:-

17Immediate and ultimate holding company
The directors regard Eastern Bank PLC., a company incorporated in Bangladesh, as being the immediate and ultimate holding 
company.
18Critical accounting estimates and judgement
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results 
of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are readily apparent from other 
sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Judgements made by management have no significant effect on the financial statements. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

Economic outlook
The year 2024 has proven to be abrupt, challenging and transformative for Bangladesh economy. The nation faced a series of economic 
odds, including rising inflation, currency devaluation, a global recession, supply chain disruptions, and the ripple effects of geopolitical 
tensions stemming from the Ukraine-Russia conflict and instability in the Middle East. These challenges were further exacerbated by a 
historic uprising in July, which led to a change in the regime. The transitional period has introduced uncertainty in both domestic business 
operations and international trade as the interim government has been implementing various reform initiatives. 
In the aftermath of this political upheaval, devastating floods inflicted severe damage across the country, leading to significant agricultural 
food shortages, further disrupting the demand-supply chain. Amid these challenges, there is a glimmer of optimism as the interim 
government has been undertaking crucial reforms aimed at stabilizing the economy. Key measures include reorganizing the boards of under 
performing banks, capital market intermediaries, exchanges, and regulatory bodies. 
Governance across various sectors has shown promising signs of improvement in the last quarter of the year, with potential for long-term 
stability. The trade deficit is narrowing, and the disbursement of foreign loans and aid is providing much-needed relief to the national 
economy during these turbulent times. Furthermore, remittances have reached a historic high, bolstering fragile foreign reserves and 

--- Page 518 ---
516supporting the country’s transition towards a market-based foreign exchange system. As a result of these concerted efforts, there is cautious 
optimism that the current economic turbulence and volatility will begin to ease, paving the way for a more stable and resilient economic 
landscape.
Capital Market Outlook
The capital market also faced significant challenges throughout 2024, driven by unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, political unrest, 
rising energy prices, and a supply chain crisis. These factors collectively led to the benchmark index shedding 1,030 points, a decline of 
16.49%, highlighting market volatility and a notable erosion of investor confidence. 
Regulatory interventions, the imposition of floor prices, market instability, and frequent policy changes further dampened investor sentiment. 
However, the interim government has prioritized critical reforms to address these issues. Key initiatives include the formation of a probe 
committee to combat corruption and irregularities, imposing substantial penalties on market manipulators, and implementing measures to 
enhance market efficiency, transparency, and vibrancy. These reform efforts, in conjunction with the gradual improvement of macroeconomic 
conditions, are expected to restore investor confidence, revive market sentiment, and improve liquidity in the capital market over time.
Mutual Fund industry outlook
The Mutual Fund industry in Bangladesh remains at a nascent stage compared to its peer markets. Currently, the sector has approximately 
BDT 149 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). Despite prevailing market turbulence and challenges, the industry continues to attract 
both individual and institutional investors, owing to its diversification benefits, professional fund management, and accessibility for small-
scale investors.
Technological integration and the digitalization of the subscription process have significantly enhanced the investment experience, creating 
a more conducive environment for fund participants. Furthermore, the introduction of diverse fund types, Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), 
and innovative financial products has encouraged investors to navigate market volatility and explore new financial instruments confidently. 
With these advancements, the Mutual Fund industry is gradually evolving into a more robust and resilient component of Bangladesh’s 
financial ecosystem. 
Roadmap to 2025
Analysts and capital market participants remain optimistic that 2025 will usher in meaningful reforms in the capital market and Mutual 
Fund industry, fostering a revival of favorable market sentiment. Additionally, the macroeconomic outlook is projected to be positive, driven 
by easing inflationary pressures, resolution of supply chain disruptions, and strengthened bilateral relations with key trading partners. With 
increased stability in the capital market, the introduction of quality IPOs and QIOs is expected to provide attractive opportunities for investors, 
contributing to a more resilient and dynamic market landscape.
In alignment with these positive developments, EBL Asset Management remains committed to upholding the principles of integrity, resilience, 
and good governance, working hand in hand with supportive investors to achieve sustainable growth and mutual success.
Internal control
The company’s internal control system is meticulously designed to ensure reliability, operational efficiency, and compliance. This system 
is rigorously implemented and continuously monitored to uphold the highest standards of integrity. The robust framework of our internal 
controls underscores the company’s unwavering commitment to safeguarding assets, ensuring accurate financial reporting, and adhering 
to all relevant regulatory requirements.
Auditor appointment
After careful deliberation and evaluation, the Board of Directors has resolved to reappoint MABS & J Partners as external auditors for the fiscal 
year 2025. This decision reflects the Board’s confidence in their professional expertise, proven track record, and commitment to upholding 
transparency and accountability in financial matters.

management team, employees, the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission, and all regulatory bodies. Their unwavering support, 
guidance, and invaluable contributions have been instrumental in driving the company’s growth and success.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024517
FINANCIAL REPORTS
Independent Auditor’s Report 
To the shareholders of EBL Asset Management Limited
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of EBL Asset Management Limited, which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 
December 2024, and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash 
flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at 
31 December 2024, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and other applicable laws and regulations.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in 
accordance with the International Ethics Standard Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and we 
have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA code and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) 
Bye Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements
Management of EBL Asset Management Limited is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs, the Companies Act 1994, the Securities and Exchange Rules 2020 and other application laws and regulations and 
such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made 
by management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 


--- Page 520 ---
518to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company 
to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, to communicate with them all relationship and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
In accordance with the Companies Act 1994 and Securities and Exchange Rules 2020, We also report the following:
a) we have obtained all the information and explanation which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose of 
our audit and made due verification thereof;
b) in our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as it appeared from our examination 
of those books;
c) the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income dealt with by the report are in 
agreement with the books of account; and
d) the expenditure was incurred for the purpose of the company’s business.

FINANCIAL REPORTS
Right of use assets (RoU)
EBLAML recognizes right-of-use assets at the date of initial application of IFRS 16. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less 
any accumulated depreciation, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term and are presented under non-current assets. 
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, EBLAML recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments 
to be made over the lease term using incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. Lease liability is measured by 
increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments, 
and re-measuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications. Interest on the lease liability in each 
period during the lease term shall be the amount that produces a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the lease liability.
Short-term leases and leases of low value assets
EBLAML assessed all live lease contracts and has chosen not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of 
low value assets and short-term leases, i.e. for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application. The 
Company recognizes lease payments associated with these leases as an expense.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and cash at bank which are held and available for use by the company without 
any restriction. There is insignificant risk of change in the value of the above items.
3.5 Recognition and measurement of financial assets

on the date at which the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the transaction. Except for trade receivables, 
a financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to its 
acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. 
3.5.1 Accounts receivable

No such receivables are accounted for if the loans are classified as bad and loss. Receivable include the amount receivable on 
interest income from loan and dividend income from investments, receivable from EBLAML 1st Unit Fund etc.
3.5.2 Investment in EBL AML 1st unit fund
Investment in EBL AML 1st unit fund is initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to its 
acquisition or issue. Where in any subsequent change in the Fair Value at the year-end is recognized to Profit & Loss Account. 
3.5.3 Investment in shares
Investment in quoted and un-quoted shares is initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable 
to its acquisition or issue recognizing any subsequent change in the Fair Value at the year-end to Profit & Loss Account. For 
quoted shares, fair Value is determined by taking the closing price of the securities in the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) at the 
statement of Financial Position date. For un-quoted shares, fair value is determined by taking last audited net asset value per 
share of the respective company.
3.6 Provision for income tax
Current tax: Provision for income tax is made on the basis of Company’s computation based on the best estimate of taxable 
profit in accordance with Income Tax Act 2023. The income tax rate is 25% at present for a private limited company or non-listed 
company in Bangladesh. Income tax expense is recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss and other Comprehensive Income 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity.

tax arises due to temporary difference (deductible or taxable) for the events or transaction recognized in the income statement. 
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.

position if, as a result of past events, the Company has a present obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that
